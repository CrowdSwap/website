The rights of users and data subjects<\/h3>\nWith regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n \t<li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);<\/li>\n \t<li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);<\/li>\n \t<li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;<\/li>\n \t<li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and\/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers\/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);<\/li>\n \t<li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.\n\n<strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller&#8217;s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.<\/strong>\n<h3>III. Information about the data processing<\/h3>\nYour data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.\n<h4>Server data<\/h4>\nFor technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.\n\nThe data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.\n\nThe basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.\n\nThe data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.\n<h4>Cookies<\/h4>\n<h5>a) Session cookies<\/h5>\nWe use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address.\n\nThis processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.\n\nThe legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.\n\nIf the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.\n\nWhen you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.\n<h5>b) Third-party cookies<\/h5>\nIf necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.\n\nPlease refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.\n<h5>c) Disabling cookies<\/h5>\nYou can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player.
