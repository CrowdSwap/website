<h2 id="h-how-to-add-avalanche-to-metamask">How to add Avalanche to MetaMask</h2>



<p>When the high speed of transactions is concerned, the Avalanche project is one of the very best nominees. Avalanche is the first smart contract platform that validates transactions in less than a second. But the attractiveness of this project is not only limited to its speed, but it enjoys a high level of security because to be hacked, taking the control of over 80% of validators will be needed. The unique architecture of Avalanche helps it have high scalability compared to other blockchain networks. The speed and scalability features help develop and run decentralised applications (dApps) like games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12868" width="500" height="375" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png 1000w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-300x225.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>MetaMask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets out there, because of its outstanding features. Being a gateway to the Web 3 ecosystem of dApps, you can connect it to different blockchain networks. Features like easy integration, ease of use, and wide compatibility with different platforms are only a few reasons why many users prefer it over other wallets. According to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-20/ethereum-overhaul-risks-creating-a-new-class-of-crypto-kingpins">MetaMask is the most popular non-custodial wallet, with 30 million users.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-steps-to-add-avalanche-to-metamask">Steps to add Avalanche to MetaMask</h2>



<p>To be able to run dApps on the Avalanche network, you need to first add the Avalanche Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet. There are two methods to do it, which will be covered in this article. Before going any further, you will need to download and install MetaMask for Chrome to follow this tutorial. If you need help installing MetaMask, you can read <a href="//web/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network/">this article</a> and follow steps 1 and 2. Let&#8217;s jump into the first and the easiest method.</p>



<h3 id="h-method-1-recommended">Method 1 (Recommended!)</h3>



<p>Step 1. <strong>Go to this address</strong>: <a href="https://avascan.info/">https://avascan.info/</a> . This is the official website of Avalanche Network.</p>



<p>Step 2. On the top bar of the page, <strong>click on the MetaMask icon, </strong>which is greyed out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1024x401.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12867" width="768" height="301" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1024x401.png 1024w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-300x118.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-768x301.png 768w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1536x602.png 1536w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Step 3. <strong>Enter your MetaMask password</strong> in the MetaMask notification pop-up window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12866" width="435" height="236" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6.png 870w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6-300x163.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6-768x417.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></figure>



<p>Step 4. Scroll down to <strong>click on Approve</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12865" width="439" height="221" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5.png 877w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5-300x151.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></figure>



<div class="wp-container-3 wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-container-2 wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%"></div>
</div>



<p>Step 5. Confirm by clicking on<strong> Switch Network</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12864" width="439" height="221" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4.png 877w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4-300x151.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></figure>



<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully added Avalanche Network to MetaMask. Now, the MetaMask icon that was greyed out in Step 1, turns colour. If you open your wallet, you should see the following window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12863" width="441" height="392" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3.png 882w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3-300x267.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3-768x683.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></figure>

<p>Now, your MetaMask wallet should be connected to Avalanche Network.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we introduced two methods to add Avalanche to MetaMask. Both are essentially the same, except that in the first method, entering the data is done automatically for you, while in the second method, you need to enter the same data manually. Either way, make sure you find the data to be entered from a reliable source.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-tvl-in-defi-why-is-it-important">What is TVL in DeFi? Why is it important?</h2>



<p>Total Value Locked (TVL) is the value of assets locked in a <a href="//web/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a> protocol in the form of staking, yield farming and loan collaterals. TVL has been a yardstick for measuring how usable and popular the entire DeFi ecosystem or a particular project is. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions. In this article, we discuss what TVL is, why is it important and how to check this useful indicator.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-tvl">What is TVL?</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s begin by noting that the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is based on the blockchain network, where there is no central authority. This means the contributors (or stakeholders, if you will) who run the system are in a decentralized network. To have an up-and-running decentralized financial system, the contributors put (lock) their assets in a liquidity pool. The liquidity pool can include amounts that are staked, farmed or put as loan collateral. TVL measures the total value of these locked assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how is TVL calculated? It is a pretty straightforward mathematical procedure. The amount of TVL is calculated by multiplying the assets locked as collateral in an ecosystem by the current price of the assets. Simply put, we can say:</p>



<p>Total Value Locked = invested assets * the assets&#8217; price.</p>



<p>Here, the key parameter to look for is that TVL depends on the transaction fees of the Ethereum network. The reason is that DeFi is, in essence, built on the Ethereum platform, and the transfer fees of DeFi tokens are paid with the help of the Ethereum network. However, the critical point is that there is a negative correlation between Ethereum network fees and TVL. This means that when the world&#8217;s second-biggest cryptocurrency transaction fees increase, the total value locked decreases.</p>



<p>In addition, the overall market conditions and the first coin of the cryptocurrency market, i.e., Bitcoin, also impact TVL. When you stake your tokens, based on the contract that you have signed, you cannot access your tokens for a while. So if the market conditions are bad, fewer investors will want to lock their tokens because they believe their value will decrease if their assets are locked somewhere. Nonetheless, long-term investors still see staking and yield farming as one of their <a href="//web/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">viable options during a bear market</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tvl-important">Why is TVL important?</h2>



<p>As DeFi grows in interest amongst investors, new projects are introduced daily. With so many new projects coming into existence, hearing about scam projects is not surprising. One needs to check some indicators to ensure a project is trustworthy and healthy. Market capitalization and the volume of trade can be good indicators to look into before investing in a DeFi project. But TVL is another factor that has a special meaning in the world of DeFi. The higher the TVL, the more reliable and healthier project. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions.</p>



<p>In addition, some investors use TVL to see if the project they intend to invest in is overvalued or undervalued. This can be done by calculating the TVL ratio. Three factors are critical for calculating the TVL ratio:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>project&#8217;s supply</li><li>maximum circulating supply</li><li>current price</li></ul>



<p>To get the TVL ratio of a DeFi project, do the following two steps:</p>



<ol><li>Multiply the project&#8217;s supply by its current price. This gives you the total market capitalization of that project.</li><li>Divide the market cap by the maximum circulating supply.</li></ol>



<p>If the resulting figure is below 1, the project is undervalued and thus attractive to investors. But if it is above 1, it probably is overvalued and less attractive for investment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>TVL is the value of total assets that are locked in the world of DeFi. TVL can act as a benchmark for the overall conditions of the DeFi ecosystem and individual projects. In addition, TVL is a reference measure for the usage, value and credibility of a DeFi protocol.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-launches-crosschain-feature-in-opportunities"><strong><strong>CrowdSwap Launches Crosschain Feature in &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;</strong></strong></h2>



<p>As of October 3, 2022, CrowdSwap has launched an update in the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> to integrate the crosschain investment feature. Let&#8217;s discuss how this feature can contribute to a safer, less complex experience of DeFi investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The crosschain solution has been around for some time now. Its main aim is to bridge different blockchains, which enables cryptocurrency users to transfer their assets across two blockchains.</p>



<p>In general, integration of the crosschain swap feature into the offered investment options can facilitate the process of staking and yield farming in many ways, some of which are explained below.</p>



<h2 id="h-higher-security"><strong><strong>Higher Security</strong></strong></h2>



<p>It is a no-brainer to any investor that the number 1 rule of investment of any kind is to make sure that your capital is safe. Therefore, you need to ensure that you don&#8217;t risk your capital in the process of investing it. Furthermore, despite the benefits of blockchain-based transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi), these come with inherent risks. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s imagine an investor would like to stake their Ethereum (ETH) on a Polygon (MATIC) liquidity pool. To do so, they need to conduct the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX0: ETH (Ethereum) -&gt; MATIC (Polygon)</p>



<p>TX1: Swap MATIC -&gt; USDC</p>



<p>TX2: Swap MATIC -&gt; MAI</p>



<p>TX3: Add Liquidity USDC/MAI to Quickswap LP &lt;- receive LP Token from this TX</p>



<p>TX4: Stake LP token</p>



<p>In some cases, the investor might need to conduct each transaction on a different platform, exposing their wallet to different kinds of threats. </p>



<p>CrowdSwap can fully eliminate this risk by offering a crosschain solution. More precisely, with this new feature, the ETH holder doesn&#8217;t need to take their ETH to MATIC to a different crosschain platform to swap it first. Rather, you can directly put your ETH to a liquidity pool, say USDC-MATIC,  and the crosschain swap is done for you automatically. With this integration of crosschain and &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;, CrowdSwap makes sure that your transactions are conducted on a highly-secure platform. Using this new feature, you can participate in investment opportunities with ease of mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png" alt="Crosschain Feature" class="wp-image-12828" width="602" height="307" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png 602w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-time-spent"><strong>Less Time Spent</strong></h2>



<p>Time is of the essence. Volatility in the crypto market can sometimes be so high that huge price changes can happen in a matter of seconds. No investor would want to see his calculations ruined after the job is done. In addition, the slippage issue has been a bottleneck for investors. If the user is to conduct all the transactions in the above example, they are exposed to time constraints. Plus, the less time you spend on transactions, the more secure your transactions will be. </p>



<p>But what if you could reduce the effect of time? This is why you can count on CrowdSwap&#8217;s new feature to conduct your transactions in the shortest time possible.  </p>



<h2 id="h-less-complexity"><strong>Less Complexity</strong></h2>



<p>Because transactions on the blockchain network are done peer-to-peer, the investor bears the sole responsibility for checking the transaction information meticulously. Once a transaction is confirmed by the validators, there is no way to revert it, because there is no central authority who has the power to override that transaction. Hence, conducting multiple transactions, often on different platforms, and signing several smart contracts increases the risks of losing your assets in the process. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go back to our earlier example. In case a mistake happens in one of the TX0, TX1, TX2, TX3 or TX4 steps, your assets may be at risk. So, a wise investor would look for ways to decrease the number of transactions to mitigate the risk. In a nutshell, the more transactions, the higher the risk of losing your assets in the middle.</p>



<p>CrowdSwap&#8217;s crosschain feature helps reduce this complexity by doing everything for you in a single transaction. Therefore, the user doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the number of transactions on several platforms, because it is done for them automatically. This way, the user can directly stake their existing tokens on any blockchain and the rest is done for them by CrowdSwap.</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-the-ultimate-solution"><strong>CrowdSwap; the Ultimate Solution</strong></h2>



<p>Now, after the successful launch of the crosschain and CCLP features by CrowdSwap in Q1, and staking and yield farming opportunities in Q3 of 2022, it is time to integrate these two features. </p>



<p>After the launch of this outstanding feature, staking and yield farming opportunities can be done in no time with high speed and exceptional security while making sure that you pay reasonable fees for it. So, head to the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> of the CrowdSwap App and make your first investment using this new feature.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-liquidity-mining">What is liquidity mining?</h2>



<p>The transformation was pretty quick. It was so promising that it was adopted almost instantly by the people. It seemed logical enough -even to the laypeople- that even the most dubious people couldn&#8217;t ignore it. Bolder investors took the lead in using it to solve many shortcomings of the traditional financial systems. It took a short time for <a href="//web/the-future-of-world-economy/">DeFi to grow in such massive popularity</a>. Soon, investment opportunities that seemed almost impossible with traditional banking were introduced one after the other. One of the myriad opportunities is very attractive to investors: liquidity mining. Let&#8217;s see what it is and how it works.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Liquidity mining (sometimes called yield farming) is the act of lending your cryptocurrencies to a cryptocurrency platform or a DeFi protocol in exchange for rewards. The reward, often in the form of the platform&#8217;s native token, can then be reinvested for higher yields or sold. In essence, it is pretty much like putting your money in the bank and receiving interest. Therefore, when you do liquidity mining, you lend your liquidity to mine (i.e., generate) cryptocurrency. This kind of investment is one of the smartest ways to <a href="//web/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">earn passive income during a bear market</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-liquidity-mining">What are the benefits of liquidity mining?</h2>



<p>Of course, every kind of investment is considered a win-win approach for both parties. Let&#8217;s consider the example of investing in the bank. The bank needs your money to grow its business, start new projects and invest in large-scale projects. Without people&#8217;s money, no bank would be able to do any of those things. On the other hand, the investor lends their money to the bank and receives interest. Liquidity mining is the same, except for the fact that you are investing in blockchain and DeFi projects. This can have benefits for both the investee and investor.</p>



<p>So, how do DeFi projects take advantage of it? By lending your cryptocurrencies to a project, you are helping it achieve its goals. For a start-up blockchain project to follow its roadmap successfully, it must be crowdfunded. Crowdfunding is a way to raise money from many people to fund a project and kickstart ideas. With the money the project raises, it can plan its future milestones more realistically and robustly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the investor gains profit by investing in the project. Depending on the nature of the project, the investor may receive a share. For example, those who have invested in a decentralized exchange (DEX) may receive a percentage of the transaction fees. Because of its high profits, more and more people are investing their assets in liquidity mining protocols, but before anything, you need to check some things out to ensure your capital stays safe.</p>



<h2 id="h-things-to-consider-before-liquidity-mining">Things to consider before liquidity mining!</h2>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent and yet important thing is to do your research revolving around the project. Make sure you check the project&#8217;s credibility by reading its whitepaper and its roadmap. Finding out how much the project has been able to keep up with its milestones set in the roadmap can be reassuring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, see if its accounts on social media like Discord and Twitter are active and if there is a strong community formed around these social media. So, if, after looking into this information meticulously, you find yourself trusting and seeing a good future in it, you&#8217;re good to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last but not least, it&#8217;s important to know that in liquidity mining, you often receive the native token of that project as your interest. This could be different from what you&#8217;ve invested initially. When investing, you are given several options for the cryptocurrency you are locking into the project. For example, in return, you can lock your USDT in the CrowdSwap project and receive CROWD tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-earn-rewards-with-crowd-mining">Earn rewards with CROWD mining</h2>



<p>As of August 2022, CrowdSwap launched its CROWD mining opportunity, which gives rewards to the participants who provided liquidity. By providing liquidity to CrowdSwap, CROWD market capitalization increases, contributing to less volatility and a steady price increase. On the date of publishing of this article, CrowdSwap offers one CROWD staking and two CROWD mining opportunities. If you don&#8217;t know the difference between yield farming and staking, make sure you read the difference <a href="//web/staking-vs-yield-farming/">here</a>.

<h2 id="h-bear-market-investment">Bear market investment</h2>



<p>So, you&#8217;ve invested in the cryptocurrency market and made a good profit out of its innate volatility. You&#8217;ve come a long way, endured a lot of stress, and seen a lot of dips that turned out to be simple corrections, after which the bull market has continued its way upwards. Everything points to the fact that the market is bullish, and now you are used to these dips as a part of the volatility. One day, another dip comes, and you react as always: keep calm. Then out of nowhere, a heavier correction follows. You get frustrated and start blaming yourself for not acting sooner. Now, you start thinking about reactions that you don&#8217;t normally consider. Welcome to the bearish market!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-does-a-bear-market-last">How long does a bear market last</h2>



<p>A bear market typically starts with a regular dip that happens in every bull market structure. Most investors think that they&#8217;ve failed to sell on time, but historically, bear markets last long enough to let investors modify their investment strategies. In the 2019-2020 period, the downtrend lasted 260 days, during which BTC lost over 80% of its value. Similarly, the 2015 bearish structure, in which BTC fell almost 75% from its ATH, lasted 410 days. The current bear market that we are in has lasted 290 days so far, with BTC down 75% from its ATH.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="399" height="225" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12172" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1.jpg 399w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1-300x169.jpg 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1-250x141.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><figcaption><em>BTC bear market durations</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-react-to-the-bearish-market">How to react to the bearish market</h2>



<p>People react differently to the bearish market, the worst of which is inaction! Remaining paralyzed in hope for the return of &#8220;the good old days&#8221; may be the worst possible reaction. Of course, there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to invest in bear market, but it is good to know how successful investors work during one. By reading this article, you can develop a mindset to alter your strategies to minimize your loss or even make a profit in a bear market. </p>



<p>It is also important to keep in mind that based on the market you are working in, your strategies may differ. This is mainly because different markets have different investment opportunities specific to them that you need to consider. Because the main focus of this article is to introduce the opportunities that exist in the cryptocurrency market, the options that you can consider are very impressive and countless. So, let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id="h-staking">Staking</h3>



<p>Proof-of-stake (PoS) is one of the very common consensus mechanisms that require the members of the community to lock their assets to be able to participate in the security and stability of that blockchain network and receive a reward in return. Protocols like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Algorand (ALGO) use this kind of consensus mechanism. No matter where your crypto assets are stored, be it in an exchange or a wallet, you can stake (lock) your tokens to earn the reward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main types of staking: locked and flexible. In locked staking, you agree to stake your assets for a certain amount of time to get the rewards, whereas, in flexible staking, you can unstake your assets any time you want. Normally, locked staking generates more rewards than flexible staking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key thing to bear in mind here is that staking can be a good idea only if you plan to keep your assets and not sell them. For instance, for a Cardano holder who does not intend to sell his tokens no matter if the market is bullish or bearish, staking may be a viable option. But obviously, if an investor&#8217;s strategy is to buy lower and sell higher, staking may not apply depending on how long they are planning to hold the asset.</p>



<h3 id="h-yield-farming">Yield farming</h3>



<p>Yield Farming is a way to earn cryptocurrency using another cryptocurrency you already own. In a broad sense, Yield Farming is any effort to work with your crypto assets and get the maximum profit from them. Yield Farming is the practice of staking or freezing cryptocurrencies in exchange for a reward. While the expectation of return on investment is nothing new, the general concept of yield farming originated from the&nbsp;<a href="//web/what-is-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized finance</a>&nbsp;(DeFi) sector. The general idea is that people can earn tokens in exchange for participating in DeFi applications.</p>



<p>Although it may seem that yield farming is the same as staking, the mechanics are quite different. Unlike speakers who are concerned about the security and stability of the blockchain network, yield farmers&#8217; only goal is to make a profit by providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol. By providing liquidity, yield farmers actually participate in different projects, be it a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a lending protocol, or the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, yield farming is not risk-free, plus the profit you get is not a fixed one and can vary depending on the project that you have invested in. On the other hand, different countries set different <a href="//web/the-future-of-world-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulations for DeFi</a>, which you need to take into account. </p>



<h3 id="h-lending">Lending</h3>



<p>Lending is one of the fascinating features of DeFi, which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These platforms enable users to lend and borrow crypto assets as an alternative to the traditional banking systems. By lending your assets to a lending platform like AAVE or COMPOUND, you can receive rewards in return. The process happens in a peer-to-peer manner through a smart contract, and there is no intermediary.</p>



<p>High-interest rates are the incentives that lending protocols offer to attract investment by lenders. These rates may sometimes be up to 20% APY, but you need to be aware of the risks. The risks of lending and borrowing crypto assets stem from the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, which leads to the rapid change in the value of the assets. </p>



<h3 id="h-mining">Mining</h3>



<p>Another way to earn profit in a downward market is mining crypto. Basically, mining is the process of solving complex mathematical equations with the help of devices called mining hardware to receive a reward. Mining can be used for tokens that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism like Bitcoin. It is a good way of making passive income, but there are some things that you need to consider about it.</p>



<p>Mining Bitcoin used to be a lot easier and more profitable years ago, and as time goes by, it gets harder. Bitcoin&#8217;s rewards to miners get halved every four years with the aim of keeping it scarce and preventing inflation. In 2009, the reward per block was 50BTC, which was distributed to the miners. However, after three halvings that took place, now the reward is 6.25BTC per block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As it gets harder to mine Bitcoin, you&#8217;re gonna need stronger and more expensive mining hardware to earn a decent reward. What you need to consider if you plan to mine Bitcoin is the cost you pay and the income you earn instead. The profit of mining depends on different factors like your hardware&#8217;s processing power and power consumption, as well as the cost of electricity. Make sure you calculate the cost and the income, and the net profit you are left with.</p>



<h3 id="h-play-to-earn-move-to-earn">Play-to-Earn/Move-to-Earn</h3>



<p>Perhaps playing a game while the market is going down could calm you down a bit, especially games that make you some money! In the crypto world, you can find games that users can play to earn. These games give you tokens as you play, and you can sell them in the market any time you want. One of the most famous play-to-earn games is Axie Infinity, which gives you SLP tokens if you win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another type of these &#8220;-to-earn&#8221; apps is move-to-earn apps that give you tokens for a good cause. They give you tokens in exchange for going outside of your home and exercising. The most popular of these apps is STEPN, which gives GST tokens to users who go out and walk, jog or run. After all, every investor needs to have some time off to get his head clear with some recreational activities to be able to get back to work stronger! So, why not do some sport?</p>



<p>But playing and moving to earn is not free, and it requires some tokens to inves in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For example, in order to be able to play Axie Infinity, you&#8217;re gonna need to purchase at least three Axis, which you can sell later, of course. In the case of STEPN, the user has to buy a pair of shoes to be able to start exercising.</p>



<h4 id="h-final-remarks">Final Remarks</h4>



<p>Investment in every financial market requires the investor to have a set of strategies. Apart from the strategies that are typical of all financial markets, knowing how the specific market you have invested in works is imperative. When the market is booming, investors follow strategies that may not work during the time when the market is going down. Therefore, investing in the bullish market is different from what you can do when the bearish phase comes. This is why you need to prepare yourself for both bullish and bearish scenarios.</p>

<p>For a cryptocurrency investor, nothing is more frustrating than the wallet or exchange showing incorrect balance. Sometimes you want to exchange your crypto assets to something else, but the incorrect balance holds you back, especially for those assets that are highly volatile. This can happen because of technical issues or not paying attention to small details. Technical issues that originate from the wallet or exchange themselves can only be solved by them and you can&#8217;t do anything about it, and you simply need to wait. But there are some issues that come from not paying attention to small details, for which we are here to help you.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-if-pancakeswap-doesn-t-show-my-bnb-balance">What to do if <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/swap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PancakeSwap</a> doesn&#8217;t show my BNB balance?</h2>



<p>Before panicking, you need to check some things to make sure that there&#8217;s nothing wrong on your side. Even experienced users may sometimes forget to check small but important things, so you need to double-check them before anything. Things like the network you are on, the type of token you have in your wallet, and other technical issues. So let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id="h-make-sure-your-bnb-is-smart-chain">Make sure your BNB is Smart Chain</h3>



<p>PancakeSwap works with BNB Smart Chain, which is a BEP20 token. Make sure that the BNB you have in your wallet is BNB Smart Chain, and not ordinary BNB which is a BEP2 token.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="715" height="630" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.jpeg" alt="Make sure your BNB is Smart Chain" class="wp-image-11177" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.jpeg 715w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-300x264.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></figure>



<p>So that balance that PancakeSwap displays to you is your BNB Smart Chain and you need to swap BNB to BNB Smart Chain to be able to conduct your transaction. It is a simple process that is done through a smart contract in Trust Wallet itself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="505" height="630" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2.jpeg" alt="Check your selected network
" class="wp-image-11178" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2.jpeg 505w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-240x300.jpeg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></figure>



<h3 id="h-check-your-selected-network">Check your selected network</h3>



<p>There are a multiple networks you can choose for your PancakeSwap, and the number of these networks may increase or decrease. If you want to conduct your transaction on the BNB Smart Chain network, make sure that you have selected the right network. The network icon is on the top right corner of your screen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="528" height="630" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-3.jpeg" alt="Check your selected network
" class="wp-image-11179" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-3.jpeg 528w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-3-251x300.jpeg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></figure>



<p>Tap on the network icon to see the list of supported networks for PancakeSwap.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="544" height="630" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.jpeg" alt="Select BNB Smart Chain" class="wp-image-11180" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.jpeg 544w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4-259x300.jpeg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></figure>



<p>Make sure that BNB Smart Chain is selected. If another network is selected, your balance will show 0.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-restart-everything">Restart everything!</h3>



<p>Sometimes other technical issues may cause the problem. So, here&#8217;s how to deal with those issues:</p>



<ol><li>Make sure you are connected to the Internet.</li><li>Close and reopen Trust Wallet.</li><li>Restart your device.</li><li>Retry in an hour in case there are technical issues with the servers or the app.</li></ol>



<p>As stated before, even experienced users may sometimes forget to check the above issues. If the problem persists after doing all the things above, contact PancakeSwap and explain the problem to them.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-add-metamask-to-cointracker">How to Add MetaMask to Cointracker</h2>



<p>As the amount of money invested in cryptocurrencies picks up, the need for investment tracking tools is becoming more evident. Plus, with the volatile nature of the crypto market and thus the highly-fluctuating portfolio values, being able to manage your portfolio and make investment decisions can be a huge help.

<p>Gas fees on the Ethereum network have always been a challenge for its users. Everyone who intends to conduct a kind of transaction on the Ethereum network has to pay an amount of gas, the value of which is always fluctuating widely. From buying and selling NFTs and transferring assets that are on the Ethereum network to executing a smart contract for any purpose, users have to pay varying amounts of gas fees.</p>



<p>Factors like network congestions lead to the increase in gas prices, putting pressure from time to time on the users.&nbsp;To deal with this issue, users always look for ways to save on Ethereum gas fees. Reducing high gas fees on Ethereum has been so important for the community that there are services around the web that tell you what time of day is best for conducting transactions for less gas fees.</p>



<p>Before going any further, let&#8217;s take brief a look at what gas fee is and why it fluctuates.</p>



<h2>What Is Gas Fee?</h2>



<p>Consensus, which guarantees that all members in the network agree on a certain state of the network, is one of the fundamental pillars of blockchain. In Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithms -which Ethereum uses-, miners employ their computing power and resources to solve mathematical puzzles. The privilege of adding that particular transaction to a block would go to the first miner who solves the puzzle.</p>



<p>In order to incentivise miners to process a transaction, an amount is paid to them. Therefore, gas fees are essentially transaction fees that are paid to miners who are participating in the Ethereum network. In a nutshell, users of blockchain networks have to pay an amount of gas fee to miners in order for their transactions to be written and recorded on the block. The amount of this gas fee is constantly changing due to the fluctuating amount of traffic of transactions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why Are Ethereum Gas Fees Always Changing?</h2>



<p>Basically, the supply and demand model plays a big role in an Ethereum gas fees calculator. In the event of greater transaction demand, miners may choose to process transactions that yield them higher gas fees. As a consequence, users would have to pay more gas in order to have their transactions processed faster or even be successful at all. Technically, higher demand for transactions may sometimes result in network congestions, which increases the gas fees.</p>



<p>The rise in popularity of the decentralised finance (DeFi) movement has put a lot of strain on the Ethereum network, which hosts the bulk of dApps. At the peak of the popularity of DeFi, users had to pay miners greater and higher transaction or gas fees. Consequently, some DeFi users may find it uneconomical to engage with decentralised apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Ethereum 2.0, the gas problem will be resolved as promised by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin. However, the update, which will be implemented in subsequent stages and would strengthen the network in many ways, could take years to complete. In the meanwhile, users can utilise a number of methods to reduce their Ethereum gas prices and find the lowest crypto transaction fees.</p>



<h2>How to Pay Less Gas Fee on Ethereum?</h2>



<p>The demand for less Ethereum gas prices has led to some solutions with which gas fees can be significantly lowered. In this article, we make five suggestions as follows.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Invest in a Layer-2 solution</li></ol>



<p>Since 2017, Ethereum’s high gas prices have been a reoccurring issue. This has generated a slew of layer-2 solutions, all of which try to dump some of Ethereum’s transaction volume to a separate network before validating the results on the main chain.</p>



<p>These can vary greatly in terms of shape and function, but many of the more popular options have been well battle-tested and can save consumers a significant amount of money on gas.</p>



<p>The most popular universal layer-2 solutions for Ethereum are Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. According to data from <a href="https://l2fees.info/">L2Fees</a>, they can reduce fees by up to 90% when transferring tokens and somewhat less when transferring ETH.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>Track Network Congestion</li></ol>



<p>Your transaction may be put on hold if the number of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain skyrockets. The gas fee keeps rising as the transaction is put on hold. As a result, once the execution process begins, your recommended gas limit will most likely decrease below the current rate. In this situation, the issue would be the potential loss of your gas payments due to an unfinished transaction.</p>



<p>Therefore, you should keep a watch on the Ethereum gas fees chart to track trends and make decisions. The general consensus is that you should schedule your Ethereum transactions during non-peak hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can use websites like <a href="https://ethereumprice.org/gas">https://ethereumprice.org/gas</a> , which show you the best time of day and week during which gas fees are lower.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-11-1024x414.png" alt="Gas Price by Time of Day and Week" class="wp-image-10982" width="768" height="311" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-11-1024x414.png 1024w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-11-300x121.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-11-768x311.png 768w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-11.png 1088w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>It is advisable to use Ethereum gas charts to find out what the current gas cost prices are in your local time zone. The chart can be used to calculate an accurate estimate of gas costs as well as to determine the ideal gas limit.</p>



<ol start="3"><li>Make Use of Gas Tokens</li></ol>



<p>When gas prices are low, you can mint gas tokens and then salvage them when prices are high, receiving a refund in ETH to help cover your gas costs.</p>



<p>The storage refund system in Ethereum allows gas tokens to function because it reimburses Ethereum users who delete storage variables. This motivates individuals to keep Ethereum’s state from becoming bloated.</p>



<p>So, using gas tokens, you basically take a snapshot of Ethereum’s state when gas costs are low and then redeem that state when gas prices are higher in order to obtain an ETH refund, which ultimately makes the crypto transaction fees less expensive.</p>



<ol start="4"><li>Use Platforms for Finding the Best Price</li></ol>



<p>Currently, there are platform that can show you the best options to swap tokens to each other with the best possible price. Platforms like <a href="//web/">CrowdSwap</a> can save you a lot of time that you would otherwise spend searching for the perfect platform to ward off gas fees. On a single webpage, CrowdSwap offers various options to swap your tokens and recommend the best choice, which has low gas fees.</p>



<p>In the example below, you can see that the CrowdSwap web app has provided multiple options for swapping the 1INCH token to AAVE. The one at the top has the lowest cost, and this can help you save time and money for swapping your cryptocurrencies to each other.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-12-1024x560.png" alt="Swap Fees of 1INCH to AAVE Token" class="wp-image-10983" width="768" height="420" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-12-1024x560.png 1024w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-12-300x164.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-12-768x420.png 768w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-12.png 1267w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<ol start="5"><li>Choose The Right Time</li></ol>



<p>Currently, there is no method to decrease the gas unit’s impact directly, but there are ways of reducing your overall fee by cutting the base fee and tip.</p>



<p>You could execute your transaction on the network during a time when fewer people are using the blockchain to lower the cost of your total gas fee by paying a lower base fee. This is because base fees are, in some ways, a reflection of demand for Ethereum. When more work is needed to engage with the Ethereum network, gas prices rise. When there are more users attempting to communicate with the network, more work is necessary.</p>



<p>As a result, if you can discover a period when there is less need to connect with the Ethereum network, you can save money on gas by lowering the transaction’s base price. Weekends are typically the ideal time to do so.</p>



<p>Lowering your tip is another way to save money on your total gas bill. Remember that our tip, also known as a priority fee, is a price we can charge miners in exchange for a speedier transaction time. Reducing your tip can be another option to save money on petrol if your transaction isn’t time-sensitive and you’re ready to wait.</p>



<h2>Wrapping It All Up</h2>



<p>The issue of high ETH gas prices isn’t going away anytime soon. These prices will drop significantly in the near future, thanks to the introduction of layer-2 scaling solutions and ETH2.</p>



<p>However, we must deal with these prices for the time being. So, the next time you need to do an Ethereum transaction, don’t do it blindly. Check the time of day, or see if the identical transaction can be done on a scaled solution, and so on. You can save a lot of ETH right now by toughening up your approach to gas.</p>

<p>The launch of CrowdSwap’s token (CROWD) will happen on the Polygon (MATIC) network. For the upcoming MASSIVE airdrop lottery and the token launch, we chose Polygon for the genesis event. Polygon network has some features that make it unique for our airdrop, hence the reason why we chose Polygon for this purpose. Before going any further, let’s take a look at the main characteristics of the Polygon network.</p>



<h2><strong>What Is Polygon (MATIC)?</strong></h2>



<p>Known also as Matic Network, the Polygon Network is a layer-2 scalability platform that was introduced as a solution to increasing the scalability of the Ethereum Network. The Polygon Network utilises a very versatile framework called Polygon SDK, which is described by the project as the “Gateway to Multi-Chain Ethereum”. The native token of Polygon network is MATIC, which has attracted a lot of attention to it in recent years.</p>



<p>The Polygon Network brings secure, convenient and fast off-chain transactions not only for payments, but also for off-network smart contracts. In fact, Polygon is a platform for building a dedicated blockchain network, combining all the features of an independent blockchain (flexibility, governance, and scalability) with the best features of Ethereum (security, developer experience, and cross-chain collaboration).</p>



<p>The main goal of the Polygon network is to provide a framework for building blockchain networks that can communicate with each other. Polygon has several innovative features such as ZK and Optimistic roll-ups. The ZK Roll-up takes a large number of transfers out of the network and consolidates them into single transactions. In addition, the Optimistic roll-up feature speeds up the transaction time. Both of these features help increase scalability and solve Ethereum&#8217;s current problem of network congestion and high transaction fees. Polygon processes up to 65,000 TPS (transactions per second) in a single sidechain, and the confirmation time of each block is under 2 seconds.</p>



<p>It is because of these features that the polygon network has reached a ton of interest. Transaction fees in the MATIC network are extremely low, which are sometimes cheaper than $0.001! Blazing fast transaction speeds make it an optimal place to start our journey. As you know, one of the main goals of CrowdSwap is to offer solutions for lower fees and fast transactions. Therefore, the features of Polygon Network described above make it the go-to blockchain network for our team to launch the CROWD token.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Add Polygon to MetaMask?</strong></h2>



<p>To participate in both the airdrop and token launch of CROWD token, you need to set up a wallet that supports the Polygon network for exchanging tokens to each other. For this purpose, we suggest using MetaMask Wallet, which is easy to set up. If you already have a MetaMask Wallet, you can use it, but if you don’t, this article helps you set up a MetaMask wallet to get you started. But before we start, make sure you have a pen and a paper at hand to make a backup of your wallet and you secure it somewhere to make sure that nobody but you has access to your recovery key.</p>



<h3>1. Install the MetaMask extension on your browser</h3>



<p>To install the MetaMask extension go to the <a href="https://metamask.io/download.html">MetaMask Download</a> page and select the appropriate version. You can either select to install mobile on iOS or android. This guide will concentrate on the browser setup. Mobile ones should almost be the same.</p>



<p>Scroll down to the section and choose the browser version that you are using.</p>

<p>First step is to create a password for your wallet. It has to have at least 8 characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>!! Choose a complex password or use a password generator to create a random password. You are responsible for your assets now !!</strong></p>



<p>&gt; Enter the password</p>



<p>&gt; Repeat the password to confirm it</p>



<p>&gt; read the “terms of use” and check it</p>



<p>&gt; Click the “create” button&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="411" height="276" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10784" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.png 411w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /></figure>



<p>&gt; Write down the sequence of words</p>



<p>You will be presented with the recovery phrase. This sequence of words is very important. You need it to import your wallet into the MetaMask extension. So, write it down and confirm this on the dialog</p>



<p>&gt; Confirm that you wrote it down somewhere</p>



<p>&gt; Click “Next”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="324" height="299" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10785" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-5.png 324w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-5-300x277.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></figure>



<p>Congratulations!</p>



<p>You have successfully created a wallet!</p>



<p>&gt; Move on to step 3</p>



<h3>3. Add the polygon (MATIC) network to MetaMask</h3>



<p>Before you can use the MetaMask wallet on the polygon network, you have to provide the connection details to the MetaMask extension. This is done by adding a new network. This is an easy task and takes you just 1 minute.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="312" height="449" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10786" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-6.png 312w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-6-208x300.png 208w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /></figure>

<h2><b>What is DeFi?</b></h2>



<p>Several years after the introduction of the blockchain network and the cryptocurrency craze in recent years, various concepts and words are being coined every day. DeFi is one of those words that has attracted a lot of attention to it, especially in 2020. DeFi stands for “decentralised finance,” a buzzword in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, which refers to financial apps aimed at eliminating intermediaries in advancing financial affairs of the world.</p>



<p>DeFi is in fact the integration of traditional banking services with decentralised technologies such as the blockchain. It is also known as Open Finance because of its pervasive nature. The key premise of DeFi is the attempt to introduce an alternative to all the current financial services in the world. These services include items such as savings and checking accounts, loans, asset trading, insurance and many more.</p>



<p>Integrating financial services into decentralised features of the blockchain opens new windows to a more financially-just world. In fact, DeFi is powered by the blockchain network, which is here to offer an alternative to centralised systems with the aim of eliminating human gatekeepers who may slow down and complicate transactions while giving consumers less direct control over their funds. Taking advantage of this feature of blockchain, DeFi offers a unique opportunity that extends the application and utility of blockchain beyond a simple transfer of assets from one person to another, towards more financial applications.</p>



<h2><b>How Was DeFi Born?</b></h2>



<p>MakerDAO, a platform that started in 2015 and enabled users to use cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans, is frequently referred to as the bedrock of DeFi and gets the credit for being the flag-bearer of decentralised finance. DeFi protocols, like regular cryptocurrencies, are introduced with the main aim of cutting out the middlemen to move towards a decentralised financial system that hands the control over to the users of financial services. DeFi extends on Bitcoin’s core principle, i.e., digital money, to provide a fully digital alternative to Wall Street, but without the accompanying fees.</p>



<p>The main goal of DeFi is to offer a more open, freer, and fairer financial market that anybody can have access to. DeFi plays an important role in the evolution of finance for many reasons. The first reason is that it expands the concept and performance of money by increasing access to it. Since all you need to participate in DeFi is just a smartphone and an active internet connection, there is a lot of potential for the global economy to expand to levels beyond our imagination. As a result, analysts see this as one of the most important developments in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.</p>



<p>There is a thriving crypto-economy out there, where you may lend, borrow, invest in long/short positions, earn interest, and many more. It has also been utilised by crypto-savvy Argentinians to avoid catastrophic inflation in their country. In addition, this revolutionary technology has helped companies to pay their employees in real-time. It might surprise you to hear that some people have even taken out and paid off multimillion-dollar loans without providing any personal information! This has been made possible through financial affairs that are decentralised thanks to the blockchain network.</p>



<h2><b>How Does DeFi Work?</b></h2>



<p>Blockchain technology, which has laid the foundation for the successful, ever-more practical application of cryptocurrencies, is also the main idea behind decentralised finance. To get a better understanding of DeFi, it can help to know how blockchain works. Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger, in which transactions are stored in the form of blocks and subsequently validated by other participants. If all of the validators reach a consensus on the validity of transactions, it is then executed. When these transactions reach a certain number on a block, that block is closed and encrypted, and a new block is generated containing information from the preceding block. The information in each subsequent block “chains” the blocks together, thus giving the blockchain its name, and there is no way to edit a blockchain since information in prior blocks cannot be modified without manipulating the subsequent blocks. The safety aspect of a blockchain is ensured through this notion, as well as other security mechanisms.</p>



<p>Through these merits of the blockchain network, DeFi introduced one of the most secure, fastest and most available forms of financial services. In fact, DeFi is a solution that addresses many shortcomings of the traditional financial systems. In decentralised finance, you don’t have to delegate the management of your money to the government or a particular business, and you don’t have to meet particular criteria to receive certain financial services.</p>



<p>Financial transactions are carried out using DeFi’s smart contracts if certain requirements are met. Borrowing, lending, and other transactions are all possible with smart contracts, and the conditions of the transaction are encoded in the code. By taking advantage of DeFi, anyone can apply for a loan, lend assets, and receive fascinating services that were not possible through traditional banking systems.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><b>What Problems Can DeFi Solve?</b></h2>



<p>A public blockchain serves as the credibility source in decentralised finance, controlling all financial transactions. On the other hand, in conventional finance, which is sometimes called Centralised Finance (CeFi), the government-controlled system includes regulations and regulated financial organisations, which serves as the source of trust, controlling all activities.</p>



<p>Apart from this control of a central authority over the users’ assets, receiving financial and banking services is not as easy in traditional financial affairs. People who want to receive banking services were traditionally required to go through the daunting process of signing paperwork and contracts with the financial institution, which in essence gives the bank the authority and control over their assets. This is not the case today, thanks to the emergence of decentralised finance, which has facilitated gaining access to these services.</p>



<p>Decentralised finance is gaining popularity in part because it is more open and transparent than traditional financial affairs. Because of the fact that it is open-source, anybody with programming abilities can contribute to the development of financial services and applications on top of public blockchains. The traditional financial system, on the other hand, has found it difficult to integrate with this new trend due to its closed nature. The need to obtain required licenses and authorisation from authorities has stifled innovation in traditional financial systems.</p>



<p>Probably the most important aspect of DeFi is the true democratisation and popularisation that it brings about. Using DeFi, the involvement of people in financial services has never been easier. No one could imagine a day when everyone would be able to give loans to other people in the simplest manner possible. This is something that the traditional financial systems cannot do because the banks are always the service providers and people are always customers who receive the limited services that the financial institution offers. With DeFi, people can sit on the other side of the desk as well!</p>



<h2><b>Why Do We Need DeFi?</b></h2>



<p>DeFi continues to play an important role in the evolution of finance for many reasons. The first reason is that it expands access to money and financial services. Since all you need to participate in DeFi is just a smartphone, there is a lot of potential for the global economy to expand beyond the current borders.</p>



<p>Decentralised applications increase developers&#8217; access to financial systems, which enables anyone from all over the world to participate in DeFi platforms. Therefore, all you need is a smartphone with internet access and you can join the DeFi community in just a few minutes.</p>



<p>As a result, DeFi dApps have the ability to provide financial services to the ‘unbanked’, which means those people who do not have a bank account or do not receive any financial service from financial institutions. Giving services to the unbanked around the world is happening for the first time in history. This is a big improvement compared to the current banking system, which does not provide any banking services to about 40% of the world&#8217;s population.</p>



<p>When thinking about the unbanked, you may imagine a remote village in the middle of the desert, but this is not the truth. Reports show that even developed countries in America and Europe have people who do not receive banking services. It may surprise you that in 2021, in the United States 7 per cent of the households are unbanked as a<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1246963/unbanked-population-in-selected-countries/"> report</a> states. DeFi provides financial services to everybody in the easiest and the most convenient manner possible.</p>



<h3><b>Advantages of DeFi</b></h3>



<p>Considering the general advantages of decentralised finance and the possibilities it offers to the general public, the technical aspects underlying this revolutionary system is what make it unique. It is these technical features that lay the ground for the countless applications of DeFi, which is limited only to your imagination. Let’s review some of these technical characteristics.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Integrity</strong></h3>



<p>Blockchain has achieved true protection thanks to the successful use of encryption techniques and consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work (PoW). As a result, the benefits and drawbacks of decentralised finance have permitted real immutability in finance.</p>



<p>It is virtually impossible to modify any record on the blockchain network, thanks to its immutability feature. Immutability, in addition to the benefits of decentralisation, provides a promising assurance of security. Surprisingly, the blockchain’s immutability features safeguard the integrity of DeFi systems for conducting financial transactions.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Full Control Over Finances</strong></h3>



<p>You can keep control of your funds using DeFi platforms and also determine what happens to your funds when you deposit them on the platform. A smart contract can qualify you for a loan or decide how you can handle your finances instead of relying on human middlemen.</p>



<p>No one has the authority to exclude you from the DeFi protocol for any reason other than your credits that come from your assets. This way, your assets determine how much you can borrow, lend or invest. Therefore, it is YOU that has the authority over your financial activities, backed by the strength and immutability of the smart contract.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Being Permissionless</strong></h3>



<p>Decentralised finance relieves the burden of relying on institutions for monitoring, data storage, server space, and other services. By ensuring that individual transaction histories can be easily disseminated among all users, blockchain networks are effective in achieving all of these qualities.</p>



<p>The decentralisation method is extremely beneficial to banking and finance democratisation. DeFi can provide everyone with easy and efficient access to financial services. The bulk of DeFi solutions operates on Ethereum. Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain network after Bitcoin by market capitalisation, and it is fully decentralised due to its permissionless nature.</p>



<p>The Ethereum network is easily available to everyone involved in the creation and usage of DeFi apps. The permissionless characteristics of blockchain in DeFi apps can potentially benefit from blockchain’s interoperability support. As a consequence, it can provide a variety of configurable alternatives for third-party integrations.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Increased Transparency</strong></h3>



<p>DeFi allows for more transparency and accountability. All activities are visible to the public since most DeFi protocols are built on the blockchain, which is a public distributed ledger. Transactions can be viewed by anybody, and unlike traditional banks, these accounts are not linked back to any certain individual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accounts instead are pseudo-anonymous, with just numerical addresses provided. Because most DeFi products are open-source, users with programming skills can audit or improve the source code. Because of community participation, open-source programmes are significantly more secure and of greater quality than proprietary software.</p>



<h2><b>DeFi Is Not Risk-Free</b></h2>



<p>No technology is risk-free, and DeFi is not an exception to this. If you plan to use the incredible services that DeFi brings about, you need to be aware of the risks as well. Many people feel that DeFi is the way to go in using financial services and that investing in such a revolutionary technology early on might pay off handsomely.</p>



<p>Newcomers to this field may find it difficult to distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy platforms and offers that can be seen all over the community these days. Examples of dead projects are all over the internet, each of which has died for a reason: hacking, smart contract bug or failure to stick to the promises and roadmaps. Take the example of YAM Protocol, which crashed amidst the peak of popularity of DeFi in 2020. The failure of YAM Protocol brought its market capitalisation from<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/13/yams-market-cap-falls-from-60m-to-zero-in-35-minutes/"> $60 million to $0 in a matter of just 35 minutes</a>! Other DeFi businesses, such as Hotdog and Pizza, suffered the same fate, with many investors losing a significant amount of money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-4-1024x422.png" alt="The fall of YAM Protocol" class="wp-image-10709" width="1024" height="422" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-4-1024x422.png 1024w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-4-300x124.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-4-768x317.png 768w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-4.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Furthermore, while the interesting features of smart contracts make transactions easier to use and more efficient, it also makes them more vulnerable to unfixable failures. Smart contracts are strong, but once the rules are baked into the protocol, they cannot be modified, which means faults are typically permanent, raising the risk.</p>



<h2><b>Where is DeFi Headed?</b></h2>



<p>Decentralised finance offers many opportunities for businesses to grow their business and facilitate the sale of products or services. Using this technology, businesses are now able to provide services to people all over the world with only a few clicks. The number of businesses and even big corporations that are accepting crypto payments is increasing day by day. To facilitate this process, there are projects that are offering crypto payment gateways. This will enable customers from all over the world to receive their products or services. In order for a business to be able to reach more customers, taking advantage of DeFi solutions is inevitable in the future.</p>



<p>Furthermore, putting an idea into practice requires either capital or funding by others. Financing a start-up has never been easier with the advent of DeFi. Decentralised finance allows entrepreneurs to crowdfund their ideas and take big steps towards their goals, something that required a lot of time and effort in the past. These are just some examples of the applications of DeFi, and many other opportunities are ahead of businesses and investors in the future, things that we might not be able to even imagine!</p>
