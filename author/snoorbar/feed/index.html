<p>Earning passive income has always been an exciting way for financial market investors. To earn passive income in the cryptocurrency market, some users search for the most profitable strategies. One of these methods is to put crypto assets into a DeFi protocol. Investors need to know that earning passive income in the cryptocurrency market has its unique characteristics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield, a common term in cryptocurrency that determines how much income you earn from your assets yearly. APY is a measure that helps compare the returns of different platforms. Knowing the concept of APY and how it works in the crypto market is essential for investors. This article thoroughly explains the core ideas behind APY and what it actually means.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-apy-mean">What Does APY mean?</h2>



<p>APY is defined as the annual percentage return on investment, considering a compounded interest rate that grows with your balance. The compound interest rate includes the reward obtained from the initial amount plus the interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investors can gain APY by staking, participating in liquidity pools, and yield farming. DeFi platforms offer various percentages of interest rates by compounding the rewards. This amount is calculated over time and added to the initial balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APY is a financial index that calculates the annual return for a certain amount of asset by using the interest-compounding method. The formula is as follows :</p>



<p>APY = (1 + r/n) ⁿ − 1</p>



<p>Which here:</p>



<p>r = periodic rate of return (or annual APR)</p>



<p>n = number of interest&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s compare simple interest and compound interest with an analogy. Imagine you stake 200 X tokens in Liquidity Pool A, which pays you 6% simple interest after one year. In that case, you can withdraw your initial holdings and a staking bonus consisting of 12 X tokens (6% multiplied by 200 X tokens). After one year of locking 200 X tokens in Liquidity Pool A, you can withdraw 212 X tokens from this pool.</p>



<p>Now imagine that Liquidity Pool B pays you a compound interest of 0.5% per deposit of 200 X tokens. If you deposit your 200 X tokens in Pool B for one year, you can withdraw 212.34 X tokens from this pool at the end of the deposit period. So, a 0.5% compound interest yields roughly the same interest as a 6% simple interest.</p>



<p>Confused, right? That&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s a concept that most people don&#8217;t fully understand the first time. To better grasp this concept, <a href="https://crowdswap.org/what-is-daily-compound-interest/">read our article about compound interest</a>.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s consider a case in point:</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-5-apy-mean">What Does 5% APY Mean?</h2>



<p>APY calculation also depends on the interest compounding period, which is variable. This means that as the figure of interest compounding periods increases, APY also grows.</p>



<p>For example, if you deposit $100,000 at a monthly interest rate of 5%, your APY will be 5.12%, calculated by the formula 100,000 x (1 + 0.05 ÷ 12)^(12). By the end of the year, your balance will be $105,116.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if compounding is daily, your final balance will be $105,127, which means an APY of 5.13%. This number results from the formula 100,000 × (1 + 0.05 ÷ 365)^(365).</p>



<p>Most DeFi platforms calculate the interest every month. Be careful if your APY is 5%, it does not necessarily mean you earn 5% interest per month. The 5% refers to the yearly earning percentage. To calculate monthly interest, take APY and divide it by 12.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-crypto-apy-pros-and-cons">Crypto APY Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>As discussed, APY represents the interest or rate of return you can earn on your assets. Your final earnings will vary depending on how long you lock your coins. Like every other financial index, it has its pros and cons and is affected by many factors.</p>



<p>Like other financial markets, inflation and supply and demand also affect the cryptocurrency market. If a large number of tokens are added to a blockchain network,&nbsp;the asset will reduce in value over time. The more inflation passes the APY rate, the less valuable the earnings will be. Also, the supply-and-demand law affects prices. When the supply is extensive, the interest rate of borrowing money is lower and vice-versa. In addition, market fluctuation results in that AYP will not last forever and will not be a zero-risk method.</p>



<p>On the other hand, noticeable advantages are why annual profit yield is popular among investors. As mentioned above, it is a passive income earned with less effort. So, what is not to like? Plus, although the percentage is calculated yearly, in some platforms, compound interest is calculated daily. Relatively, the investor can withdraw the initial principal plus the earned profit whenever they want. In other words, you will earn APY until you lock your deposit into the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-apy-vs-apr">APY vs. APR?</h2>



<p>APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the interest you gain from your investment in one year and is expressed as a percentage. It may also include interest paid by borrowers in lending platforms. This index helps compare different investment products, for it constructs a consistent basis for determining the annual interest rate.</p>



<p>APY and APR are similar, but there is no interest compounding in APR.</p>



<p>For example, if you stake 10,000 coins with an APR of 10 %, you will earn 1,000 coins after one year, but the APY conditions differ.</p>



<p>The following formula is used to calculate APR :</p>



<p>APR = [( fees + interest ) ÷ P] ÷ n × 365 × 100</p>



<p>where P is the major investment and N is the number of days of the period.</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-s-apy">CrowdSwap&#8217;s APY&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The APY of crypto assets changes constantly and is subject to supply and demand on various protocols. This fluctuation can happen at any moment due to the variable nature of the crypto market. As a DeFi platform, CrowdSwap provides opportunity services with a reasonable APY rate. At the date of this article, on October 18, 2022, CROWD mining offers around 328.37% APY on USDT/CROWD pool for yield farming and 25.00% for CROWD staking. For more information, take a look at the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">Opportunities</a> service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, investors need to acknowledge various methods of depositing and earning to compare options and calculate the profit they may obtain or the risks they may come across. APY is one of the most desirable interest-earning ways in the DeFi ecosystem. By comparing different options in terms of APY, you can choose the best investment opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the introduction of smart contracts, the world of cryptocurrencies saw a significant transformation. It is not an exaggeration to say that smart contracts have revolutionized the growth and development of cryptocurrencies. They showed that the blockchain network is not limited to merely sending and receiving currency and can be used to create and develop complex applications. Modern cryptocurrencies are trying to provide exceptional and exciting services to their users using smart contracts. Binance, considered one of the largest centralized exchanges (CEX), has launched its BNB Smart Chain platform to use all the capabilities of the blockchain network.</p>



<p>BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a platform created by Binance to run applications based on smart contracts. This network works in parallel with the main network of Binance (Binance Chain &#8211; BC) and allows users to use the capabilities of both networks.</p>



<p>In addition, BNB Smart Chain has also implemented Ethereum virtual machine technology in its network. This technology allows the BSC network to run applications based on the Ethereum network, such as MetaMask. The purpose of creating the BSC network is to provide the possibility of developing decentralized applications for developers. Also, this platform helps users to transfer any amount of their assets in the shortest possible time.</p>



<p>Due to its outstanding features, MetaMask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets on the market today. In addition, it can be connected to a wide range of blockchain networks since it is a gateway to the Web 3 ecosystem of dApps. There are many reasons why many users prefer it over other wallets, such as its easy integration, ease of use, and compatibility across different platforms. These are only a few reasons many users prefer it over other wallets. According to Bloomberg, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-20/ethereum-overhaul-risks-creating-a-new-class-of-crypto-kingpins">more than 30 million users</a>, MetaMask is the most popular non-custodial wallet in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-steps-to-add-bsc-to-metamask">Steps to add BSC to MetaMask</h2>



<p>To be able to run dApps on the BNB Smart Chain network, you need first to add the BSC Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet. There are three methods to do it, which we will cover in this article. Before going any further, you will need to download and install MetaMask for Chrome to follow this tutorial. If you need help installing MetaMask, you can read <a href="https://crowdswap.org/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network/">this article</a> and follow steps 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Now, your MetaMask wallet should be connected to BSC Network.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we introduced three methods to add BNB Smart Chain (BSC) to MetaMask. All three are essentially the same, except that entering the data is done automatically for you in the first and second methods. In contrast, in the third method, you must manually enter the same information. Either way, ensure you find the data you want to enter from a reliable source.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CrowdSwap has been busy. After a series of successful projects, now it&#8217;s time to facilitate yield farming BNB Smart Chain (BSC) tokens. With this new feature, CrowdSwap users are now able to seize investment opportunities on the BSC network in no time. Users can short-cut the complex procedure of participating in the CAKE/BNB pool with only a few clicks. </p>



<p>For people who are long-time holders of BNB, finding a way to earn passive income is crucial. That&#8217;s why CAKE/BNB pool is one of the popular yield farming pools out there. However, to participate in those pools, you need to follow a complex process that can be confusing even to experienced users. CrowdSwap has recently launched a feature that can simplify this process to a tremendous amount. So, buckle up; let&#8217;s see how it&#8217;s done. Read more about <a href="https://crowdswap.org/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">ways you can earn passive income during the bear market</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-it-s-typically-done">How it&#8217;s typically done</h2>



<p>Typically, investors who want to participate in the CAKE/BNB pool refer to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/">PancakeSwap</a>. On this DEX, the user has to conduct multiple transactions to get the work done. Imagine you hold some BUSD and want to participate in this pool. In that case, you have to perform the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX1: Swap BUSD for BNB</p>



<p>TX2: Swap BUSD for CAKE</p>



<p>TX3: Add liquidity and receive LP token</p>



<p>TX4: Add LP token to pool</p>



<p>The above four transactions are the typical process of yield farming for cryptocurrency pairs. This is almost the same for all DEXes out there. But what if you could do all the above transactions in one? This feature is now available for CrowdSwap users to help them save a lot of time and effort. Follow along with the article to find out how CrowdSwap facilitates this.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-crowdswap-does-it">How CrowdSwap does it</h2>



<p>CrowdSwap has launched a new feature to shorten the journey of farming CAKE/BNB and make it more exciting through fast-lane transactions. With this feature, you are only a few clicks away from yield farming your tokens. In the above example, if you have BUSD in your wallet, your balance will automatically appear, and you only need to click on &#8220;Allow to use your BUSD.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-9.png" alt="CAKE/BNB yield farming" class="wp-image-12984" width="497" height="426" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-9.png 663w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-9-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /></figure>



<p>After you click this button, your MetaMask wallet will show up, and you will be prompted to confirm the transaction. Once the confirmation is done, you can hit &#8220;Invest,&#8221; and you&#8217;re done. Therefore, a few simple steps can put your assets into a liquidity pool for yield farming. But this does not end here. There&#8217;s another cool feature: cross-chain.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-also-cross-chain">It&#8217;s also cross-chain</h2>



<p>Another fascinating characteristic of this new feature is that it supports cross-chain swaps. This means that if you have tokens on other blockchain networks, you can glide freely between blockchains and participate in another chain&#8217;s opportunities. If you need more information about cross-chain technology, <a href="https://crowdswap.org/cross-chain-technology-unmasking-the-myths/">read this article</a>. Let&#8217;s elaborate on this with a simple example. Imagine you have some Ethereum (ETH) and want to farm CAKE/BNB (done on the BSC network). Typically, you would have to conduct the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX1: Swap ETH&nbsp; (on Ethereum network) for BNB (on BSC network)</p>



<p>TX2: Swap ETH (on Ethereum network) for CAKE (on BSC network)</p>



<p>TX3: Add liquidity (BNB and CAKE) and receive LP token</p>



<p>TX4: Add LP token to pool</p>



<p>Because ETH is on a different network than BNB and CAKE, one needs to do the swap through another procedure and then go back to the actual transactions. But thanks to the cross-chain feature, you have no limitations. This means you don&#8217;t need to swap your ETH to CAKE and BNB first and then put your liquidity in the pool. In fact, the procedure is done precisely as in the BUSD example, as if your ETH is already on the BSC network. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-875x1024.png" alt="CAKE/BNB yield farming" class="wp-image-12985" width="438" height="512" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-875x1024.png 875w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-256x300.png 256w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-768x899.png 768w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10.png 1235w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></figure>



<p>Currently, four networks are available on CrowdSwap: Avalanche, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. If you have assets on any of these four blockchains, you can still put your assets in the CAKE/BNB pool. This is done without the need for any excessive swaps. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>



<p>CrowdSwap has made it simpler for its users to use yield farming opportunities on the BSC network. CS users are now able to farm CAKE/BNB without being involved in the cumbersome procedure of swapping tokens. So, everything is done automatically by CrowdSwap for the user, thanks to its meticulous planning. Make sure you <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity/asset">visit this address</a> and conduct your first transaction.</p>

<p>When the high speed of transactions is concerned, the Avalanche project is one of the very best nominees. Avalanche is the first smart contract platform that validates transactions in less than a second. But the attractiveness of this project is not only limited to its speed, but it enjoys a high level of security because to be hacked, taking the control of over 80% of validators will be needed. The unique architecture of Avalanche helps it have high scalability compared to other blockchain networks. The speed and scalability features help develop and run decentralised applications (dApps) like games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12868" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png 1000w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-300x225.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>MetaMask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets out there, because of its outstanding features. Being a gateway to the Web 3 ecosystem of dApps, you can connect it to different blockchain networks. Features like easy integration, ease of use, and wide compatibility with different platforms are only a few reasons why many users prefer it over other wallets. According to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-20/ethereum-overhaul-risks-creating-a-new-class-of-crypto-kingpins">MetaMask is the most popular non-custodial wallet, with 30 million users.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-steps-to-add-avalanche-to-metamask">Steps to add Avalanche to MetaMask</h2>



<p>To be able to run dApps on the Avalanche network, you need to first add the Avalanche Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet. There are two methods to do it, which will be covered in this article. Before going any further, you will need to download and install MetaMask for Chrome to follow this tutorial. If you need help installing MetaMask, you can read <a href="https://crowdswap.org/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network/">this article</a> and follow steps 1 and 2.

<p>Now, your MetaMask wallet should be connected to Avalanche Network.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we introduced two methods to add Avalanche to MetaMask. Both are essentially the same, except that in the first method, entering the data is done automatically for you, while in the second method, you need to enter the same data manually. Either way, make sure you find the data to be entered from a reliable source.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 id="h-what-is-tvl-in-defi-why-is-it-important">What is TVL in DeFi? Why is it important?</h2>



<p>Total Value Locked (TVL) is the value of assets locked in a <a href="https://crowdswap.org/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a> protocol in the form of staking, yield farming and loan collaterals. TVL has been a yardstick for measuring how usable and popular the entire DeFi ecosystem or a particular project is. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions. In this article, we discuss what TVL is, why is it important and how to check this useful indicator.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-tvl">What is TVL?</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s begin by noting that the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is based on the blockchain network, where there is no central authority. This means the contributors (or stakeholders, if you will) who run the system are in a decentralized network. To have an up-and-running decentralized financial system, the contributors put (lock) their assets in a liquidity pool. The liquidity pool can include amounts that are staked, farmed or put as loan collateral. TVL measures the total value of these locked assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how is TVL calculated? It is a pretty straightforward mathematical procedure. The amount of TVL is calculated by multiplying the assets locked as collateral in an ecosystem by the current price of the assets. Simply put, we can say:</p>



<p>Total Value Locked = invested assets * the assets&#8217; price.</p>



<p>Here, the key parameter to look for is that TVL depends on the transaction fees of the Ethereum network. The reason is that DeFi is, in essence, built on the Ethereum platform, and the transfer fees of DeFi tokens are paid with the help of the Ethereum network. However, the critical point is that there is a negative correlation between Ethereum network fees and TVL. This means that when the world&#8217;s second-biggest cryptocurrency transaction fees increase, the total value locked decreases.</p>



<p>In addition, the overall market conditions and the first coin of the cryptocurrency market, i.e., Bitcoin, also impact TVL. When you stake your tokens, based on the contract that you have signed, you cannot access your tokens for a while. So if the market conditions are bad, fewer investors will want to lock their tokens because they believe their value will decrease if their assets are locked somewhere. Nonetheless, long-term investors still see staking and yield farming as one of their <a href="https://crowdswap.org/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">viable options during a bear market</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tvl-important">Why is TVL important?</h2>



<p>As DeFi grows in interest amongst investors, new projects are introduced daily. With so many new projects coming into existence, hearing about scam projects is not surprising. One needs to check some indicators to ensure a project is trustworthy and healthy. Market capitalization and the volume of trade can be good indicators to look into before investing in a DeFi project. But TVL is another factor that has a special meaning in the world of DeFi. The higher the TVL, the more reliable and healthier project. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions.</p>



<p>In addition, some investors use TVL to see if the project they intend to invest in is overvalued or undervalued. This can be done by calculating the TVL ratio. Three factors are critical for calculating the TVL ratio:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>project&#8217;s supply</li><li>maximum circulating supply</li><li>current price</li></ul>



<p>To get the TVL ratio of a DeFi project, do the following two steps:</p>



<ol><li>Multiply the project&#8217;s supply by its current price. This gives you the total market capitalization of that project.</li><li>Divide the market cap by the maximum circulating supply.</li></ol>



<p>If the resulting figure is below 1, the project is undervalued and thus attractive to investors. But if it is above 1, it probably is overvalued and less attractive for investment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>TVL is the value of total assets that are locked in the world of DeFi. TVL can act as a benchmark for the overall conditions of the DeFi ecosystem and individual projects. In addition, TVL is a reference measure for the usage, value and credibility of a DeFi protocol.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-launches-crosschain-feature-in-opportunities"><strong><strong>CrowdSwap Launches Crosschain Feature in &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;</strong></strong></h2>



<p>As of October 3, 2022, CrowdSwap has launched an update in the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> to integrate the crosschain investment feature. Let&#8217;s discuss how this feature can contribute to a safer, less complex experience of DeFi investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The crosschain solution has been around for some time now. Its main aim is to bridge different blockchains, which enables cryptocurrency users to transfer their assets across two blockchains.</p>



<p>In general, integration of the crosschain swap feature into the offered investment options can facilitate the process of staking and yield farming in many ways, some of which are explained below.</p>



<h2 id="h-higher-security"><strong><strong>Higher Security</strong></strong></h2>



<p>It is a no-brainer to any investor that the number 1 rule of investment of any kind is to make sure that your capital is safe. Therefore, you need to ensure that you don&#8217;t risk your capital in the process of investing it. Furthermore, despite the benefits of blockchain-based transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi), these come with inherent risks. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s imagine an investor would like to stake their Ethereum (ETH) on a Polygon (MATIC) liquidity pool. To do so, they need to conduct the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX0: ETH (Ethereum) -&gt; MATIC (Polygon)</p>



<p>TX1: Swap MATIC -&gt; USDC</p>



<p>TX2: Swap MATIC -&gt; MAI</p>



<p>TX3: Add Liquidity USDC/MAI to Quickswap LP &lt;- receive LP Token from this TX</p>



<p>TX4: Stake LP token</p>



<p>In some cases, the investor might need to conduct each transaction on a different platform, exposing their wallet to different kinds of threats. </p>



<p>CrowdSwap can fully eliminate this risk by offering a crosschain solution. More precisely, with this new feature, the ETH holder doesn&#8217;t need to take their ETH to MATIC to a different crosschain platform to swap it first. Rather, you can directly put your ETH to a liquidity pool, say USDC-MATIC,  and the crosschain swap is done for you automatically. With this integration of crosschain and &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;, CrowdSwap makes sure that your transactions are conducted on a highly-secure platform. Using this new feature, you can participate in investment opportunities with ease of mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png" alt="Crosschain Feature" class="wp-image-12828" width="602" height="307" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png 602w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-time-spent"><strong>Less Time Spent</strong></h2>



<p>Time is of the essence. Volatility in the crypto market can sometimes be so high that huge price changes can happen in a matter of seconds. No investor would want to see his calculations ruined after the job is done. In addition, the slippage issue has been a bottleneck for investors. If the user is to conduct all the transactions in the above example, they are exposed to time constraints. Plus, the less time you spend on transactions, the more secure your transactions will be. </p>



<p>But what if you could reduce the effect of time? This is why you can count on CrowdSwap&#8217;s new feature to conduct your transactions in the shortest time possible.  </p>



<h2 id="h-less-complexity"><strong>Less Complexity</strong></h2>



<p>Because transactions on the blockchain network are done peer-to-peer, the investor bears the sole responsibility for checking the transaction information meticulously. Once a transaction is confirmed by the validators, there is no way to revert it, because there is no central authority who has the power to override that transaction. Hence, conducting multiple transactions, often on different platforms, and signing several smart contracts increases the risks of losing your assets in the process. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go back to our earlier example. In case a mistake happens in one of the TX0, TX1, TX2, TX3 or TX4 steps, your assets may be at risk. So, a wise investor would look for ways to decrease the number of transactions to mitigate the risk. In a nutshell, the more transactions, the higher the risk of losing your assets in the middle.</p>



<p>CrowdSwap&#8217;s crosschain feature helps reduce this complexity by doing everything for you in a single transaction. Therefore, the user doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the number of transactions on several platforms, because it is done for them automatically. This way, the user can directly stake their existing tokens on any blockchain and the rest is done for them by CrowdSwap.</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-the-ultimate-solution"><strong>CrowdSwap; the Ultimate Solution</strong></h2>



<p>Now, after the successful launch of the crosschain and CCLP features by CrowdSwap in Q1, and staking and yield farming opportunities in Q3 of 2022, it is time to integrate these two features. </p>



<p>After the launch of this outstanding feature, staking and yield farming opportunities can be done in no time with high speed and exceptional security while making sure that you pay reasonable fees for it. So, head to the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> of the CrowdSwap App and make your first investment using this new feature.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-liquidity-mining">What is liquidity mining?</h2>



<p>The transformation was pretty quick. It was so promising that it was adopted almost instantly by the people. It seemed logical enough -even to the laypeople- that even the most dubious people couldn&#8217;t ignore it. Bolder investors took the lead in using it to solve many shortcomings of the traditional financial systems. It took a short time for <a href="https://crowdswap.org/the-future-of-world-economy/">DeFi to grow in such massive popularity</a>. Soon, investment opportunities that seemed almost impossible with traditional banking were introduced one after the other. One of the myriad opportunities is very attractive to investors: liquidity mining. Let&#8217;s see what it is and how it works.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Liquidity mining (sometimes called yield farming) is the act of lending your cryptocurrencies to a cryptocurrency platform or a DeFi protocol in exchange for rewards. The reward, often in the form of the platform&#8217;s native token, can then be reinvested for higher yields or sold. In essence, it is pretty much like putting your money in the bank and receiving interest. Therefore, when you do liquidity mining, you lend your liquidity to mine (i.e., generate) cryptocurrency. This kind of investment is one of the smartest ways to <a href="https://crowdswap.org/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">earn passive income during a bear market</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-liquidity-mining">What are the benefits of liquidity mining?</h2>



<p>Of course, every kind of investment is considered a win-win approach for both parties. Let&#8217;s consider the example of investing in the bank. The bank needs your money to grow its business, start new projects and invest in large-scale projects. Without people&#8217;s money, no bank would be able to do any of those things. On the other hand, the investor lends their money to the bank and receives interest. Liquidity mining is the same, except for the fact that you are investing in blockchain and DeFi projects. This can have benefits for both the investee and investor.</p>



<p>So, how do DeFi projects take advantage of it? By lending your cryptocurrencies to a project, you are helping it achieve its goals. For a start-up blockchain project to follow its roadmap successfully, it must be crowdfunded. Crowdfunding is a way to raise money from many people to fund a project and kickstart ideas. With the money the project raises, it can plan its future milestones more realistically and robustly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the investor gains profit by investing in the project. Depending on the nature of the project, the investor may receive a share. For example, those who have invested in a decentralized exchange (DEX) may receive a percentage of the transaction fees. Because of its high profits, more and more people are investing their assets in liquidity mining protocols, but before anything, you need to check some things out to ensure your capital stays safe.</p>



<h2 id="h-things-to-consider-before-liquidity-mining">Things to consider before liquidity mining!</h2>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent and yet important thing is to do your research revolving around the project. Make sure you check the project&#8217;s credibility by reading its whitepaper and its roadmap. Finding out how much the project has been able to keep up with its milestones set in the roadmap can be reassuring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, see if its accounts on social media like Discord and Twitter are active and if there is a strong community formed around these social media. So, if, after looking into this information meticulously, you find yourself trusting and seeing a good future in it, you&#8217;re good to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last but not least, it&#8217;s important to know that in liquidity mining, you often receive the native token of that project as your interest. This could be different from what you&#8217;ve invested initially. When investing, you are given several options for the cryptocurrency you are locking into the project. For example, in return, you can lock your USDT in the CrowdSwap project and receive CROWD tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-earn-rewards-with-crowd-mining">Earn rewards with CROWD mining</h2>



<p>As of August 2022, CrowdSwap launched its CROWD mining opportunity, which gives rewards to the participants who provided liquidity. By providing liquidity to CrowdSwap, CROWD market capitalization increases, contributing to less volatility and a steady price increase. On the date of publishing of this article, CrowdSwap offers one CROWD staking and two CROWD mining opportunities. If you don&#8217;t know the difference between yield farming and staking, make sure you read the difference <a href="https://crowdswap.org/staking-vs-yield-farming/">here</a>.

<h2 id="h-bear-market-investment">Bear market investment</h2>



<p>So, you&#8217;ve invested in the cryptocurrency market and made a good profit out of its innate volatility. You&#8217;ve come a long way, endured a lot of stress, and seen a lot of dips that turned out to be simple corrections, after which the bull market has continued its way upwards. Everything points to the fact that the market is bullish, and now you are used to these dips as a part of the volatility. One day, another dip comes, and you react as always: keep calm. Then out of nowhere, a heavier correction follows. You get frustrated and start blaming yourself for not acting sooner. Now, you start thinking about reactions that you don&#8217;t normally consider. Welcome to the bearish market!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-does-a-bear-market-last">How long does a bear market last</h2>



<p>A bear market typically starts with a regular dip that happens in every bull market structure. Most investors think that they&#8217;ve failed to sell on time, but historically, bear markets last long enough to let investors modify their investment strategies. In the 2019-2020 period, the downtrend lasted 260 days, during which BTC lost over 80% of its value. Similarly, the 2015 bearish structure, in which BTC fell almost 75% from its ATH, lasted 410 days. The current bear market that we are in has lasted 290 days so far, with BTC down 75% from its ATH.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="399" height="225" src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12172" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1.jpg 399w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1-250x141.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><figcaption><em>BTC bear market durations</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-react-to-the-bearish-market">How to react to the bearish market</h2>



<p>People react differently to the bearish market, the worst of which is inaction! Remaining paralyzed in hope for the return of &#8220;the good old days&#8221; may be the worst possible reaction. Of course, there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to invest in bear market, but it is good to know how successful investors work during one. By reading this article, you can develop a mindset to alter your strategies to minimize your loss or even make a profit in a bear market. </p>



<p>It is also important to keep in mind that based on the market you are working in, your strategies may differ. This is mainly because different markets have different investment opportunities specific to them that you need to consider. Because the main focus of this article is to introduce the opportunities that exist in the cryptocurrency market, the options that you can consider are very impressive and countless. So, let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id="h-staking">Staking</h3>



<p>Proof-of-stake (PoS) is one of the very common consensus mechanisms that require the members of the community to lock their assets to be able to participate in the security and stability of that blockchain network and receive a reward in return. Protocols like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Algorand (ALGO) use this kind of consensus mechanism. No matter where your crypto assets are stored, be it in an exchange or a wallet, you can stake (lock) your tokens to earn the reward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main types of staking: locked and flexible. In locked staking, you agree to stake your assets for a certain amount of time to get the rewards, whereas, in flexible staking, you can unstake your assets any time you want. Normally, locked staking generates more rewards than flexible staking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key thing to bear in mind here is that staking can be a good idea only if you plan to keep your assets and not sell them. For instance, for a Cardano holder who does not intend to sell his tokens no matter if the market is bullish or bearish, staking may be a viable option. But obviously, if an investor&#8217;s strategy is to buy lower and sell higher, staking may not apply depending on how long they are planning to hold the asset.</p>



<h3 id="h-yield-farming">Yield farming</h3>



<p>Yield Farming is a way to earn cryptocurrency using another cryptocurrency you already own. In a broad sense, Yield Farming is any effort to work with your crypto assets and get the maximum profit from them. Yield Farming is the practice of staking or freezing cryptocurrencies in exchange for a reward. While the expectation of return on investment is nothing new, the general concept of yield farming originated from the&nbsp;<a href="https://crowdswap.org/what-is-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized finance</a>&nbsp;(DeFi) sector. The general idea is that people can earn tokens in exchange for participating in DeFi applications.</p>



<p>Although it may seem that yield farming is the same as staking, the mechanics are quite different. Unlike speakers who are concerned about the security and stability of the blockchain network, yield farmers&#8217; only goal is to make a profit by providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol. By providing liquidity, yield farmers actually participate in different projects, be it a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a lending protocol, or the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, yield farming is not risk-free, plus the profit you get is not a fixed one and can vary depending on the project that you have invested in. On the other hand, different countries set different <a href="https://crowdswap.org/the-future-of-world-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulations for DeFi</a>, which you need to take into account. </p>



<h3 id="h-lending">Lending</h3>



<p>Lending is one of the fascinating features of DeFi, which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These platforms enable users to lend and borrow crypto assets as an alternative to the traditional banking systems. By lending your assets to a lending platform like AAVE or COMPOUND, you can receive rewards in return. The process happens in a peer-to-peer manner through a smart contract, and there is no intermediary.</p>



<p>High-interest rates are the incentives that lending protocols offer to attract investment by lenders. These rates may sometimes be up to 20% APY, but you need to be aware of the risks. The risks of lending and borrowing crypto assets stem from the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, which leads to the rapid change in the value of the assets. </p>



<h3 id="h-mining">Mining</h3>



<p>Another way to earn profit in a downward market is mining crypto. Basically, mining is the process of solving complex mathematical equations with the help of devices called mining hardware to receive a reward. Mining can be used for tokens that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism like Bitcoin. It is a good way of making passive income, but there are some things that you need to consider about it.</p>



<p>Mining Bitcoin used to be a lot easier and more profitable years ago, and as time goes by, it gets harder. Bitcoin&#8217;s rewards to miners get halved every four years with the aim of keeping it scarce and preventing inflation. In 2009, the reward per block was 50BTC, which was distributed to the miners. However, after three halvings that took place, now the reward is 6.25BTC per block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As it gets harder to mine Bitcoin, you&#8217;re gonna need stronger and more expensive mining hardware to earn a decent reward. What you need to consider if you plan to mine Bitcoin is the cost you pay and the income you earn instead. The profit of mining depends on different factors like your hardware&#8217;s processing power and power consumption, as well as the cost of electricity. Make sure you calculate the cost and the income, and the net profit you are left with.</p>



<h3 id="h-play-to-earn-move-to-earn">Play-to-Earn/Move-to-Earn</h3>



<p>Perhaps playing a game while the market is going down could calm you down a bit, especially games that make you some money! In the crypto world, you can find games that users can play to earn. These games give you tokens as you play, and you can sell them in the market any time you want. One of the most famous play-to-earn games is Axie Infinity, which gives you SLP tokens if you win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another type of these &#8220;-to-earn&#8221; apps is move-to-earn apps that give you tokens for a good cause. They give you tokens in exchange for going outside of your home and exercising. The most popular of these apps is STEPN, which gives GST tokens to users who go out and walk, jog or run. After all, every investor needs to have some time off to get his head clear with some recreational activities to be able to get back to work stronger! So, why not do some sport?</p>



<p>But playing and moving to earn is not free, and it requires some tokens to inves in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For example, in order to be able to play Axie Infinity, you&#8217;re gonna need to purchase at least three Axis, which you can sell later, of course. In the case of STEPN, the user has to buy a pair of shoes to be able to start exercising.</p>



<h4 id="h-final-remarks">Final Remarks</h4>



<p>Investment in every financial market requires the investor to have a set of strategies. Apart from the strategies that are typical of all financial markets, knowing how the specific market you have invested in works is imperative. When the market is booming, investors follow strategies that may not work during the time when the market is going down. Therefore, investing in the bullish market is different from what you can do when the bearish phase comes. This is why you need to prepare yourself for both bullish and bearish scenarios.</p>

<p>For a cryptocurrency investor, nothing is more frustrating than the wallet or exchange showing incorrect balance. Sometimes you want to exchange your crypto assets to something else, but the incorrect balance holds you back, especially for those assets that are highly volatile. This can happen because of technical issues or not paying attention to small details. Technical issues that originate from the wallet or exchange themselves can only be solved by them and you can&#8217;t do anything about it, and you simply need to wait. But there are some issues that come from not paying attention to small details, for which we are here to help you.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-if-pancakeswap-doesn-t-show-my-bnb-balance">What to do if <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/swap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PancakeSwap</a> doesn&#8217;t show my BNB balance?</h2>



<p>Before panicking, you need to check some things to make sure that there&#8217;s nothing wrong on your side. Even experienced users may sometimes forget to check small but important things, so you need to double-check them before anything. Things like the network you are on, the type of token you have in your wallet, and other technical issues. So let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id="h-make-sure-your-bnb-is-smart-chain">Make sure your BNB is Smart Chain</h3>



<p>PancakeSwap works with BNB Smart Chain, which is a BEP20 token. Make sure that the BNB you have in your wallet is BNB Smart Chain, and not ordinary BNB which is a BEP2 token.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="715" height="630" src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.jpeg" alt="Make sure your BNB is Smart Chain" class="wp-image-11177" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.jpeg 715w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-300x264.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></figure>



<p>So that balance that PancakeSwap displays to you is your BNB Smart Chain and you need to swap BNB to BNB Smart Chain to be able to conduct your transaction. It is a simple process that is done through a smart contract in Trust Wallet itself.</p>
