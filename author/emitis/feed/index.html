Of course, these features mainly come from the development department but are completed with information from other areas. The following information letter should only deal with essential features which were implemented by February 2022. The order is purely arbitrary</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCLP light saves auction participants</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big problem with the auction on Gnosis was the transfer of tokens and coins to the Polygon network. Many have failed to send these from Ethereum to Polygon. The team decided to launch a light version of the CCLP to help out without hesitation. It was worth it. Not only was this of help for many people to eventually participate in the auction. Also, the team was given the chance to gain initial experience on the mainnet, which was a nice side effect. Big thanks to the development team!</span></p><p><b> </b></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A link to add the &#8220;CROWD&#8221; token to the wallet on Polygon</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most DeFi wallets, only the large coins and tokens are known &#8211; unfortunately not the CROWD token. In the current version of the app, however, you will find a CrowdSwap logo button with which you can simply add the CROWD token to the selected network. This currently only works on the Polygon network, as CROWD has not yet been released on Ethereum and BSC.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate Gnosis auction for launching crowd token</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of time was spent evaluating and testing the Gnosis auction platform. We put everything through its paces to assure that, in the end, everything would work during the auction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there were typical issues with transactions and wallet connections. However, the auction went smoothly and by now most have claimed their CROWD tokens from the auction. Henceforward, we can look further ahead towards staking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distribute CROWD tokens to airdrop winners</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, in December we had to postpone the distribution of the Airdrop (airdrop?) CROWD tokens to February. Thank you to everyone who took part and waited patiently for the distribution. As compensation, the tokens won could be staked for 50% APR over 6 weeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge effort was the distribution of the tokens to the more than 1000 winners, which could be done almost immediately after the auction, thanks to the team.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withdraw CROWD Token from Vesting Contract</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The so-called vesting contract provides an important function. This smart contract ensures that access to CROWD tokens from the Private Sale, Team, and Advisors areas is only possible after a certain holding period. The vesting contract does not offer the project/team the opportunity to change anything about the distributions that were made before. From our point of view, this is a fundamental part of a vesting contract.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to security, the release of CROWD tokens distributed before the public auction at the right time is, of course, also an important function. Many have already been able to test the withdrawal in the app and receive the first tokens. The feedback was consistently positive and claimed the CROWD tokens did not cause any issues.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CrowdDex is coming</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CrowdSwap will develop its Liquidity Protocol and of course, it makes sense to have our decentralized exchange as well. The CrowdDEX is well advanced in development and will also be introduced as part of the CCLP as soon as the first liquidity pools have been created.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will receive results like this more often.</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8174 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CrowdDex-is-coming.png" alt="CrowdDex is coming" width="605" height="269" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CrowdDex-is-coming.png 605w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CrowdDex-is-coming-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p><h2> </h2><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design for adding and removing liquidity</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the CrowdDEX we need liquidity pools. These do not necessarily have to be created by CrowdSwap. Anyone can create such pools and provide liquidity for them. To make this as easy as possible, the UX team has already completed the necessary dialogs here.</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8175 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Design-for-adding-and-removing-liquidity.png" alt="Design for adding and removing liquidity" width="605" height="386" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Design-for-adding-and-removing-liquidity.png 605w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Design-for-adding-and-removing-liquidity-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p><h2> </h2><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the integration of other DEXes</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CrowdSwap thrives on integrating more and more DEXes into the application. In the past, this always required a new release of the Smart Contracts, which is very time-consuming on the one hand, and on the other hand, it cost a few thousand dollars, especially on Ethereum. With a change to so-called &#8220;low-level&#8221; calls, the team has now achieved that new DEXes can be integrated more easily and cost-effectively.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staking for CROWD token</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to stake your token is a great feeling and a MUST in every project! The team, together with the UX designers, have completed a well-structured easy-to-use staking UI that people enjoy visiting once every morning to take a look at the rewards section.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time indication showing when the next rewards are available gives each user transparency about their staking. The 40% APY can be maintained at the current level until the end of the year. However, we reserve the right to change APY after each quarterly period.</span></p>						</div>

Here&#8217;s how they are allocated:</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7099" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/item-token-pie-chart-1-300x121.png" alt="CROWD Token Tokenomics" width="1476" height="596" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/item-token-pie-chart-1-300x121.png 300w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/item-token-pie-chart-1-1024x413.png 1024w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/item-token-pie-chart-1-768x310.png 768w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/item-token-pie-chart-1.png 1476w" sizes="(max-width: 1476px) 100vw, 1476px" /></p><p>We are launching the CROWD token on the Gnosis Auction platform. To learn more about our token, click <a href="//web/token1/">here</a>.</p><h2><strong>Step-By-Step Guide To Participate In The CROWD Token Sale</strong></h2><h3><strong>Step #1: Complete our whitelisting process</strong></h3><p>To make sure that there is no suspicious activity involved in the CROWD token sale, we require all our users to go through a verification process. It involves adding your name, surname, email, and wallet address through the following link: <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/whitelisting">https://app.crowdswap.org/whitelisting</a></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7311 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.png" alt="" width="1116" height="670" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.png 1116w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-300x180.png 300w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1024x615.png 1024w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1116px) 100vw, 1116px" /></p><p>Connect your wallet, add in the details and click ‘Submit’.</p><h3><strong>Step #2: Participate In The Auction When Public Sale Goes Live</strong></h3><p>Make sure your wallet contains the amount you wish to pay in USDT, as well as some MATIC for gas costs. On the day the auction goes live, the CROWD token sale will be mentioned on this <a href="https://gnosis-auction.eth.limo/#/overview#topAnchor">link</a> as one of the &#8216;Featured Auctions.&#8217;</p><h3><strong>Step #3: Connect Your Wallet</strong></h3><p>Link your crypto wallet and ensure that this wallet matches the one you registered with during the whitelisting procedure. Next, you should go to the &#8216;Featured Auctions&#8217; section and look for the CROWD token auction.</p><h3><strong>Step #4: Submit Your Bid</strong></h3><p>Everything you need to know about participating in the public sale is available on the Gnosis Auction dashboard page of the CROWD token.</p><p>When you&#8217;re all set to place your bid, ensure your wallet is unlocked. In the &#8216;Place Order&#8217; area, click &#8216;Unlock,&#8217; confirm it, and wait for it to proceed. In the &#8216;Place Order&#8217; area, enter the amount you wish to spend in USDT in the &#8216;Amount&#8217; column.</p><p>Then, in the &#8216;Max Bidding Price&#8217; section, enter your desired bid for one $CROWD token.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The lowest bid you can place is 0.05 USDT, as that is the minimum sell price that will be calculated automatically on the Gnosis Auction platform.</p><p>When you&#8217;ve finished placing your order, verify it and scroll down to see your previous orders.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>During the first 24 hours of the auction, you can cancel your bid; however, after this timeframe has passed, all bids are final.</p><h3><strong>Final Step: Wait For The End Time Of The Auction</strong></h3><p>After the auction is completed, you must wait for the clearance price to be established. Anyone who puts the order below the clearing price will not get any $CROWD tokens, and their unspent funds will be available to collect after the auction is over.</p><p>The $CROWD token will then be awarded to the auction winners and made accessible for the claim at the clearing price.</p><p>See the step-by-step guide with screenshots that walks you through all the steps to commit order.</p><h2><strong>Why Are We Launching On Gnosis Auction?</strong></h2><p>The CROWD token team looked into many auction platforms and found the Gnosis Auction to be the best one. This is because Gnosis Auction is a tool that determines token prices in a fair, transparent, and decentralized manner. It helps everyone involved in the CROWD token sale to:</p><h3><strong>Find the Lowest Price</strong></h3><p>Batch auctions determine the price where supply and demand intersect, which guarantees that all participants pay the same fair fee for the token.</p><h3><strong>Be 100% Fair</strong></h3><p>Gas conflicts and other types of manipulation are avoided. And the final pricing is determined by the willingness to pay, and scheduled batches prevent users from frontrunning.</p><h3><strong>Enjoy Simplicity</strong></h3><p>Auctioneers have the liberty to start an auction using the Gnosis Safe App or by running a simple script, while bidders can simply engage in auctions by selecting two parameters, which include quantity and price.</p><h2><strong>Important Points To Note</strong></h2><ul><li>People may misunderstand the auction procedures and feel compelled to place big bids. However, this is not advised because all the winners will receive their $CROWD tokens at the same final clearing price established by the community of bidders.</li><li>Making extremely high bids and then canceling late in the auction process to deter other bidders are common examples of auction manipulation. The cancellation will then lower the clearing price, allowing manipulators to get a better deal than they would have gotten otherwise. This risk is addressed by the option to cancel bids after a set amount of time has passed in the auction and the need that bidders commit their funds to the smart auction contract before their bid is legitimate.</li><li>The fair batch auction approach requires buyers to select the price they believe the $CROWD token is worth based on the project&#8217;s value. At the end of the auction, this is the clearing price. Regardless of the amount they invested, all auction winners will obtain their tokens at the very same clearing price.</li></ul><p>We wish you all the best of luck. See you at the CROWD token auction scheduled to be held on <strong>18th February 2022.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><h2><strong>Step-by-Step auction walkthrough</strong></h2><p>This guide describes the necessary steps to bid in an auction.  We created this test auction on the polygon network for showcasing, only. In the real auction on the 18th of February only the token symbol and the minimum price will change.</p><p>If you enter the auction, you will see a screen like this. Since the auction is private everybody needs to whitelist their wallet addresses beforehand. The process is described in Step 1 of the brief introduction. Keep in mind that your whitelisting has to be uploaded to the auction. This might take some time when the auction has already been started.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7348 size-large" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-1024x543.png" alt="" width="1024" height="543" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-1024x543.png 1024w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-300x159.png 300w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-768x407.png 768w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-1536x814.png 1536w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1.png 1713w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><p>If your whitelisting has been successful and is active on the auction, reload the auction page you should see the place order mask with the auction token pair.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7349 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1.png" alt="" width="2367" height="1590" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1.png 2367w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1-300x202.png 300w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1-1024x688.png 1024w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1-768x516.png 768w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1-1536x1032.png 1536w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-1-2048x1376.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2367px) 100vw, 2367px" /></p><p>To place an order you have to set the amount of USDT that you want to spend and the maximum or limit price that you are willing to bid for one CROWD token.

							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miner Extractable Value [MEV] in crypto refers to the value extracted by miners from handling the transactions that make up a block in a Blockchain network. Miners are usually incentivized to complete blocks that form the Blockchain. The value earned is usually above the block reward and gas fee. Miners can achieve this to earn new currency and the fees from transactions in a block. By using resources to monitor transactions in a network, miners can derive value from completed blocks in the network. The inclusion, exclusion or ordering of transactions enables miners to optimize the returns they gain from the completed blocks. Thus, the incentive offered to miners can lead to the fast or slow transaction processing time for the pending transactions.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">Types of Attacks in MEV</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort to increase the profits earned from transactions leads miners to use extreme strategies to earn from user transactions. This makes it useful to examine front running attacks. It enables miners to take advantage of the information available on pending transactions in the memory pool. To carry out the attacks, bots monitor the memory pool for potentially profitable transactions. Miners can then place orders before the completion of such transactions, earning the miner a profit. The ability to maintain and benefit from confidentiality when carrying out transactions is compromised. The security in transactions remains necessary for users in the Blockchain network. Users are also disadvantaged as they have to compete with miners and bots, who have more information on the pending transactions in the memory pool, in completing their transactions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attempt to solve the problems associated with Miner Extractable Value leads to limited but effective options. Users can decrease the incentives that bots get from their transactions. This is possible as the transactions remain pending in the memory pool and await to be added to blocks. Another option is to use specialized platforms that can boost the user’s security. The platforms can also counter front- and back running or sandwich attacks on their pending transactions. In both options, miners maintain the useful role of miners and bots in adding transactions to blocks in the network.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">How does MEV protection work?</span></h2><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Adjust your slippage</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process involves making your transaction unattractive to bots in order to mitigate the risks associated with miner extractable value. In this, you can set a low slippage level for your transaction prior to the initiation of the cross-chain swap. For example, a 1% setting tells bots that the transaction has low tolerance to sharp changes in market prices. The result is a low incentive to bots to carry out a front running operation on the transaction. The user gets a good bargain from their pending transaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of adjusting slippage on the pending transaction is that the user retains control on their transactions. But, the users could also have to deal with longer waiting times as the transactions offer little incentive to miners. The incentive of adjusting your slippage is saving on the high ancillary costs that come with Miner Extractable Value. Much savings over time make this a worthwhile option for users to explore when carrying out crypto transactions.</span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Protection through System Side Integrations</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from adjusting slippage when initiating crypto transactions, users can also rely on the security mechanism built into premium tools. The security features in some of the market-leading tools prevents miners and bots from reordering or changing transactions before execution. A mined transaction on a different chain makes the additional layer of protection possible. The tool eliminates the possibility of executing a front running operation. The best tools for MEV protection available in the market give users the option to select MEV protection. The extra security gives users the needed peace of mind. In this case, users choose their options when initiating their transactions. By enabling MEV protection, users can complete the process in a secure and reliable environment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To work your way around the risks and challenges of MEV there is the alternative use of tools. The problems that come with MEV in crypto makes the decision to use secure platforms the better option. CrowdSwap’s MEV protection makes it one of the useful platforms you can consider for your crypto transactions.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">How CrowdSwap’s MEV Protection Works</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CrowdSwap offers a secure and reliable platform to ensure MEV protection. The system side integrations built into the platform ensure that you can carry out safe crypto transactions. The security features eliminate the fear of front- and back running or sandwich attacks. As a leading platform in the market, CrowdSwap enables users to transact in a safe environment. You can participate in DEXes with the confidence of low ancillary costs and cost-optimized routing for your transactions. The system side security features deter potential attacks that might occur prior to the execution of the user’s transactions. The following figure shows how the CrowdSwap platform can protect you against failing transactions through MEV protection.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CrowdSwap confirms the security hash on a mined block from the different networks. Hence, the platform provides a strong layer of security against the different MEV-based attacks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, MEV presents one of the major challenges of executing crypto transactions. It allows miners the opportunity to earn high profits for handling transactions. MEV leads to attacks and the creation of inefficiencies in the Blockchain network. Users are left vulnerable as they are exposed to the profit-optimization tactics of miners and bots in the network. An effective way of tackling the challenges associated with Miner Extractable Value is to use a secure platform such as CrowdSwap.</span><a href="//web/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Get started now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with CrowdSwap&#8217;s system side integrations to execute crypto transactions in a secure and reliable environment.</span></p>						</div>

							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto gains or loses value when a set of factors, ranging from the supply and demand of the currencies to hidden market forces, influence the circulation of the crypto in the market. Based on the volatility of crypto, an increase or loss of value can lead to huge gains or losses for investors. So it is best that, as an investor, you invest in a crypto that is likely to offer the highest returns on your investment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like fiat currencies, crypto is also designed to be a medium of exchange. Crypto exchange occurs between users in a Blockchain network. It shows the value exchange for products and services in the real world. The online network also maintains a record of each transaction. The records increase the level of transparency as consequent transactions are recorded over the network.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the volatility of crypto, there comes another huddle, which attempts to predict future values for different crypto in the market. It is an uphill task to predict future changes in crypto value if not impossible. In this case, being familiar with how activities such as crypto trading and crypto exchange work will get you started in making a wise crypto investment decision.</span></p><h2><b>Crypto Trading and Changes in Crypto Values</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engagement in crypto trading is one of the ways that users in a Blockchain network can influence crypto value. Crypto trading is similar to trading in stocks, where the sale of a company&#8217;s shares takes place in the stock market. Thus, users engaged in crypto trading can raise the value of a crypto by reducing its supply in the market. The limited supply leads to an increase in the level of cryptocurrency demand. Cryptocurrencies with high demand in the market have a high value and can increase the fortunes of those holding them in a short period of time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto trading with the aim of increasing crypto value also includes the optimization of trading routes to ensure you have maximum returns from the trading activity. Optimal conversions can occur as users perform crypto exchange over the same network or over different networks. For the crypto exchange over the same network, users send the same tokens over a Blockchain network. In exchanges over different networks, users perform cross-chain swaps using premium tools such as</span><a href="//web/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CrowdSwap platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helps to achieve optimal results from the swaps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The efficiency of the crypto trading process, including how fast and cost-friendly it is to transfer crypto, also influences the value of cryptocurrencies.</span></p><h2><b>Crypto Circulation in the Market</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto circulation is an additional factor that influences crypto value. The level of circulation in the market signifies the acceptance of crypto and their growing range of applications. The increase in crypto circulation emerges from the acceptance and popularity of concepts such as smart contracts. Users use smart contracts as a mode of payment in business transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the number of users of a cryptocurrency can increase and therefore it results in a rise in demand and consequent increase in value of the cryptocurrency.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited circulation and applications of a cryptocurrency have the opposite effect. As a result, users will refuse to hold on to cryptocurrency as they are unable to apply it to a wide range of applications in the financial market.  </span></p><h2><b>Crypto Mining Process</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production of crypto takes place through complex computational activities and extensive use of power resources. The rate of crypto mining has a direct effect on the amount of crypto in circulation and an indirect effect on crypto value. Therefore, controlled cryptocurrency mining activities ensure that the cryptocurrencies maintain high value in the market. Control measures also ensure cryptocurrencies to serve a wide range of functions in the market.</span></p><h2><b>Using CrowdSwap to Increase Crypto Value</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your ability to increase the value of your virtual tokens is most likely limited to the extent of your knowledge on available trading tools. To increase the value of crypto you can use services available on the market. A good application can help you avoid the lows of a volatile cryptocurrency. This is acheived by comparing the value of different crypto and performance cross-chain swaps in a fast and cost-friendly way. An example is acquiring Stablecoins through a cross-chain swap to avoid losses from the volatility of a cryptocurrency. CrowdSwap can help you achieve all that and more. The CrowdSwap search app has the ability to find the best route for your crypto exchange (shown below).</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7140 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12.png" alt="" width="624" height="215" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12.png 624w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12-300x103.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that you will end up with tokens of a higher value. You will also spend less on the routing process. Another unique feature of the CrowdSwap platform is that it allows all users to participate in crypto trading. If you are just getting started and don’t have tokens to enable you to carry out the crypto exchange or aren’t allowed to sign up for centralized exchanges, the CrowdSwap platform gives you the chance you need. CrowdSwap’s architecture enables all users to participate in crypto trading and crypto exchange.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform gives all users the opportunity to trade and in effect influence the crypto value in the market.</span></p><h2><b>Get started with CrowdSwap</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the changes in the DeFi space, users have higher control over the extent of losing or gaining crypto value. Market analysis shows that tools such as CrowdSwap platform offer unique benefits. Users can make an effort to improve their knowledge about how crypto works in crypto trading and crypto exchange. The wide range of crypto uses in the market can help one to get a high value from the available crypto. CrowdSwap is the way to go as you seek protection from low crypto values.</span></p>						</div>

							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can send crypto to family, friends, or complete business transactions in simple and easy to follow steps. As a form of digital currency, crypto makes it convenient to initiate and complete a transaction from anywhere around the world. The limitations and boundaries of the past are no longer a barrier as you transfer crypto across borders and complete your transactions in a secure online environment. This means that you can now send crypto as easily as an email without revealing your personal information in the process. In order to fully tap into the potential benefits linked to the use of crypto as a digital currency, it is important to familiarise yourself with sending crypto from your wallet to others in the same crypto network. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To successfully transfer crypto, both you and your recipient need to have crypto wallets, which are secure addresses for storing the received crypto. The wallet address is usually made up of several characters that might be difficult to memorize. But there is no need to worry as you can scan the crypto wallet address as a QR code. Despite the high level of security associated with crypto as a digital currency, you still have the responsibility of taking additional measures to protect your digital assets. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following are the steps to follow when sending crypto to another crypto wallet. </span></p><h2><b>1. Log in to your crypto wallet</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you will be sending crypto from your own wallet to an intended recipient, you will first need to sign in to your wallet. A crypto wallet app will enable you to sign in to your account and to select the option to transfer crypto. Open the send crypto page by following the send/receive link on your screen. </span></p><h2><b>2. Enter the recipient’s wallet address</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The send crypto page displays sections that you will need to fill before clicking the send button. The first section requires that you enter the recipient’s public key. Crypto wallets come with a pair of keys that help to keep the digital assets secure. The keys also enable crypto users to send and receive crypto from other users in the Blockchain network. In the pair of keys, there is a public key, which is shared among the people sending and receiving crypto, while the private key helps to maintain the security of your wallet. As shown below, enter the recipient’s public key, which will enable them to receive the crypto you send. </span></p><h2><b><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7002 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png" alt="" width="739" height="431" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png 739w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></b></h2><h2><b>3. Enter the amount to send</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter the amount of crypto you would like to send. Ensure the funds in your wallet can cover the amount you wish to send in addition to the ‘gas fee’. The gas fee is used to facilitate the transaction in the Blockchain and is added to the amount you intend to send to the recipient. In case the amount in your wallet is not enough to cover the fee, you might need to ensure there is enough amount before proceeding. </span></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7003 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3.png" alt="" width="739" height="431" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3.png 739w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are just getting started on how to send crypto, it is important to check whether you are sending in crypto or fiat amounts. For example, 2 USD is significantly different from 2 Bitcoin and has an impact on the fees charged for your transaction. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intensity of DeFi activity on a network such as Ethereum influences the amount of gas fee paid to complete the transaction. An example is in sending a specific amount of DAI to another user in the same network. The amount of fee charged for transactions carried over a network are used to ensure that the network resources perform at an optimal level. </span></p><h2><b>4. Verify and send</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the recipient’s address and the amount you want to send once more to verify all details are correct. The irreversible nature of crypto transactions can prove costly if you end up making an avoidable mistake. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of sending crypto might seem difficult at first but proves efficient once you get familiar yourself with the process. To familiarise with the process, you might set up multiple crypto wallets for practice. Sending crypto between the wallets you have opened will help you get the swing of it. You will also have the opportunity to learn the process without the fear of losing crypto through avoidable mistakes. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you send crypto to the intended recipient, confirmation for the transaction usually occurs instantly but might take a few minutes as the transaction is included in a block. In addition to the short time taken to complete the transaction, the security of the transaction grows as the number of consequent transactions grows on the network. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important point to note with aspects such as the estimation of gas fee is that it is a work in progress and will improve with time.</span></p><h1><b>Using CrowdSwap’s Wallet Manager</b></h1><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The possibility of using special tools such as CrowdSwap makes the process of managing your crypto wallets an efficient one. It is a tool built on the need to increase efficiency as you manage multiple crypto wallets. In this case, CrowdSwap’s wallet manager enables you to manage crypto wallets in different networks, while eliminating the complexity involved in monitoring each network. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the process of sending crypto from one crypto wallet to another is efficient and offers numerous benefits compared to using non-digital currency. The sender and recipient enjoy high levels of security as the details of their transaction are recorded in an online ledger. The stability of crypto such as DAI makes it possible to carry out transactions in an efficient way. As the Blockchain networks continue to improve, users will have increased opportunities to send crypto at affordable fees. The integration of useful and upcoming tools such as CrowdSwap’s wallet manager increases the power and usability of sending crypto from one user to the other in a network. The use of such tools will enable you to use the best route that gives the best pricing for sending crypto from one wallet to another. </span></p>						</div>
