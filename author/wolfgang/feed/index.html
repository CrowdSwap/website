<p>The trading of cryptocurrencies in so-called decentralized financial markets (DeFi) based on blockchains and smart contracts is rapidly growing into a new form of global finance via the nearly 70 decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (so-called DEXes). Already, about 2,000 cryptocurrencies or coins/tokens are traded on crypto exchanges &#8211; with a daily turnover of about USD 5 billion, on some days up to USD 10 billion. In the last 6 years alone, the crypto market grew by 45 000%; 450% since last May.</p>



<p><strong>A big problem in the crypto market</strong> today is the <strong>lack of transparency</strong> regarding the different transaction costs in the various DEXes and the lack of insight about in the fair price of a cryptocurrency in the respective crypto exchange.</p>



<p>Especially for beginners, this can mean that they have to pay <strong>up to 100% more for an exchange</strong> in cryptocurrencies than necessary. Even for experienced DeFi traders, it is <strong>almost impossible to get an overview with reasonable effort</strong> to get the best price for their swap.</p>



<p>The German startup CrowdSwap now solves this problem. It was founded by a mixed software developer team of Germans and Iranians. They are familiar with blockchain projects in the German energy industry and have spent a year developing <strong>best price routing blockchain technology</strong>.<br>With their system, which incorporates both cryptocurrency prices and associated transaction costs, they aim to bring more transparency to the burgeoning global crypto market.</p>



<p>Transparency is also the thread that runs through the professional life of (?) entrepreneur Christian Mülder, software developer, stock market trader and investor, and Blockchain is the 100% tool what makes this possible. Back in 2006, he was a co-initiator in the open source project B2B By Practice. The software is used by 60% of all German energy providers and implements the communication and mapping of processes of the German energy market using blockchain-like technology. His first company, which he sold in 2016, enabled him to start as a trader and investor, and for him it was obvious from his own experience that transparency in the crypto market urgently needed to be established: &#8220;I was supposed to pay transaction costs of USD 100 when exchanging a coin worth USD 500. This was not disclosed to me on the exchange. 20% in incidental investment costs is not acceptable. This gave me the idea to develop a price comparison for cryptocurrencies with my old peers,&#8221; Mülder said.</p>



<p>CrowdSwap is going live in early June 2021 with its crypto price comparison app in a beta version, available for exchanges of the 2,000 major cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum network on initially 5 of the major DEXes. <strong>Traders can compare crypto prices, swap directly across different DEXes, and CrowdSwap promises an average of 20-30% cost savings</strong> when swapping cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>In doing so, CrowdSwap displays 100% transparent all prices and costs that await a crypto trader and calculates the total price a trader has to pay for a currency swap.</p>



<p>In the beta phase, CrowdSwap itself does not charge any fees; however, they are already displayed in the price comparison.</p>
