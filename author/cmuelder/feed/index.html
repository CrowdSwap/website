<h2 id="h-crowdswap-partners-with-omniaverse-to-take-metaverse-gaming-to-the-next-level"><strong>CrowdSwap partners with OmniaVerse to take metaverse gaming to the next level</strong></h2>



<p>CrowdSwap is proud to announce its partnership with <a href="https://omniaverse.io/">OmniaVerse</a>, a multi-chain platform that allows its users to monetize their artwork using metaverse-supported gaming platforms. Through the support of CrowdSwap, OmniaVerse will be able to add best-price routing and swaps seamlessly to their platform.</p>



<h3 id="h-status-quo"><strong>Status quo</strong></h3>



<p>After the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies, play-to-earn (P2E) games have become commonplace among gamers. Even non-gamers have shown interest in blockchain-based games because of their unique P2E experience. Besides the concentration on NFTs, OmniaVerse wants to integrate a swap functionality for cryptocurrency swaps into their project tokens and future tokens that will launch on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-solution-and-partnership"><strong>The solution and partnership</strong></h3>



<p>CrowdSwap&#8217;s best-price routing and swap feature is one of the most popular features used and appreciated by our community daily. We are excited that Omniaverse will be the first project to natively incorporate this function into their platform via the CrowdSwap API. The API will give Omniaverse&#8217;s community direct access to the supported blockchains Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche. As part of the collaboration, we will continuously expand the functionality of the API. The need for atomic cross-chain swaps already exists and will be essential in a proper multi-chain environment. Cross-chain swaps will be integrated into the API next, allowing Omniaverse to add a seamless multi-chain feeling to its offering automatically.</p>



<p>Best-price routing is based on a meshed graph over the liquidity pools of the respective blockchains. These graphs determine the best routes to the requested coins and tokens. The various prices of the DEXes are then further matched with the swap ancillary costs before a processed ranking is returned to the callers. Price and cost are based on on-chain data that is constantly updated to achieve the best possible result.</p>



<p>Through the CrowdSwap API, projects can natively and easily integrate the benefits of a best-price swap solution into their application, delivering a one-stop user experience to their community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OmniaVerse and CrowdSwap agreed to start a strategic collaboration bringing synergies from different areas of our businesses together for our communities. We are thrilled to explore the opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-partners-with-resonate-to-innovate-and-simplify-defi-products">CrowdSwap partners with Resonate to Innovate, and simplify DeFi products</h2>



<p>CrowdSwap is proud to announce our new partnership with <a href="https://www.resonate.finance/">Resonate</a>. Resonate is a DeFi Yield Futures protocol that makes future yield available right at the start of the investment. The innovative FNFT (financial NFT) solution gives the user access to immediate rewards and liquidity throughout the locking term.&nbsp; Through the support of Resonate, CrowdSwap will open up innovative staking crypto opportunities and liquidity mining offers to its loyal users that are second to none.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-challenge">The challenge</h2>



<p>In uncertain times, many participants in the financial markets tend to shy away from risk. Of course, this is also true for the DeFi market. The more optimistic, the more likely an individual is to use yield farms or DeFi staking offers, where the capital deposited is locked in for a certain period of time. As a result, these offers are taken up less and thus the liquidity needed for the projects is not available.</p>



<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be perfect if users could directly access all the staking rewards upfront and the protocols still withheld their liquidity?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-solution">The solution</h2>



<p>This is exactly where Resonate comes in. The DeFi Yield Futures protocol assures users of the agreed staking rewards directly, so they don&#8217;t have to wait until the end of the investment period. Uncertainty about future rewards development is no longer a limiting factor.</p>



<p>There are two key advantages when considering the implementation of Resonate. The first of which is the payout time of the rewards, which are paid out right at the beginning rather than over time &#8211; these staking rewards can then be used to either cover one&#8217;s long position or take advantage of further opportunities in DeFi. Secondly, the FNFT will always remain liquid, as it can be sold on most NFT marketplaces despite the underlying tokens remaining locked throughout. This unique concept also helps CrowdSwap to set up the project in a more stable way in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-and-resonate-partnership">CrowdSwap and Resonate Partnership</h2>



<p>In addition, CrowdSwap and Resonate will work together on innovative and optimized DeFi products that can ultimately benefit everyone through their simplicity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are already good examples of how higher returns can be achieved by cleverly composing DeFi opportunities. Delta hedging strategies, to name just one. CrowdSwap concentrates on simplifying such processes for all users and making them transparent without ignoring the risk factor. With Resonate we have the optimal partner for innovative DeFi products, which can be well integrated into CrowdSwap&#8217;s opportunities. CrowdSwap and Resonate will collaborate on:</p>



<ul><li>Creating Innovative DeFi Products&nbsp;<ul><li>Yield Futures, Stablecoin boosting, Synthetic Swaps</li></ul></li><li>Optimizing Yield<ul><li>Composing DeFi recipes for better yield</li></ul></li><li>Simplifying the DeFi processes&nbsp;</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Quote:</em></p><cite><em>Resonate is enthralled to have a long-term partner on its side to develop the next generation of DeFi applications. We strongly believe by integrating with CrowdSwap, we are a step closer to creating a harmonious, highly effective and frictionless DeFi ecosystem, for users and protocols alike. We look forward to working together, now and in the future to make this vision a reality.</em><br><br><em>Rob Montgomery &#8211; CEO, Resonate</em><br></cite></blockquote>



<h2 id="h-about-resonate-finance">About Resonate Finance</h2>



<p>Resonate is a Yield Futures Protocol developed by Revest Finance and built on top of Revest’s Financial NFT (FNFT) technology. Using Resonate, we’re able to separate the principal and interest components of a position by issuing two FNFTs; one containing the principal and the other containing the rights to future interest on that principal. Resonate facilitates the commerce of the rights to future interest by matching issuers (who want to sell their interest rights for a one-time upfront payment), and purchasers (who want to buy the rights to future interest for a one-time upfront payment).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-about-revest-finance">About Revest Finance</h2>



<p>The Revest Protocol offers a revolutionary new use of NFTs as financial tools through the Financial Non-Fungible Token (FNFT). Individual and enterprise-level users can deposit any ERC-20 or ERC-721 into Revest’s interactive FNFTs and set custom unlocking conditions (time, value, or contract-based). Revest allows the tokenization of all non-fungible financial positions with non-fungible tokens. This simple turn-key solution offers elegant applications ranging from token vesting to cutting-edge implications for derivative and borrowing/lending platforms. Revest’s flagship product, Resonate, is underpinned, fundamentally, by this innovative technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since there have been many questions about the current long-term holder incentive, I would like to clarify the intent of this incentive, as well as the rules, with examples once more.</p>



<h2 id="Long-termholder-english-Background">Background</h2>



<p>Every crypto project depends crucially on the users and their belief in the project for the long term. Most of these users buy tokens of these projects very early and then hold them for a longer period of time. They form the backbone of a project and stick to it even when there is a headwind. The last bull run has shown that these users are becoming increasingly rare and greed has taken over. So, the reason for this incentive is a repayment of advance trust in CrowdSwap.</p>



<p>Requests were sent asking for other rules to push buying pressure. This might be effective but was not the trigger for this incentive.</p>



<h2 id="Long-termholder-english-Rules">Rules</h2>



<h4 id="Long-termholder-english-Termsofparticipation">Terms of participation</h4>



<ol type="1"><li>Any purchase of CROWD is eligible for participation if the number of CROWD tokens at the deadline is &gt;10K.</li><li>Each sale of CROWD terminates participation in the incentive. Regardless of the number of tokens sold, unless the last action was a buy.</li></ol>



<h4 id="Long-termholder-english-Winningconditions:">Winning conditions:</h4>



<ol type="1"><li>All participants (&gt;10K CROWD and last action was a BUY) are sorted by purchase date.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Example: BUY and HOLD</strong></p>



<p>User A:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>BUY/SELL</strong></td><td><strong>Amount</strong></td><td><strong>Total</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01.03.2022</td><td>BUY</td><td>10.000 CROWD</td><td>10.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>User B:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>BUY/SELL</strong></td><td><strong>Amount</strong></td><td><strong>Total</strong></td></tr><tr><td>02.03.2022</td><td>BUY</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Both users have bought and held CROWD. They are therefore eligible to participate, since they also own at least 10K CROWD. User B lands on second place, because he has bought later than user A!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td><strong>Buying date</strong></td><td><strong>User</strong></td><td><strong>CROWD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>01.03.2022</td><td>User A</td><td>10.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>02.03.2022</td><td>User B</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Example: BUY → SELL</strong></p>



<p>User A:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>BUY/SELL</strong></td><td><strong>Amount</strong></td><td><strong>Total</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01.03.2022</td><td>BUY</td><td>20.000 CROWD</td><td>20.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>01.04.2022</td><td>SELL</td><td>8.000 CROWD</td><td>12.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>User B:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>BUY/SELL</strong></td><td><strong>Amount</strong></td><td><strong>Total</strong></td></tr><tr><td>02.03.2022</td><td>BUY</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The SALE of user A is the last action and prevents participation. As a result, user B is now in 1st place</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td><strong>Buying date</strong></td><td><strong>User</strong></td><td><strong>CROWD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>02.03.2022</td><td>User B</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Example: BUY → SELL → BUY</strong></p>



<p>User A:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>BUY/SELL</strong></td><td><strong>Amount</strong></td><td><strong>Total</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01.03.2022</td><td>BUY</td><td>20.000 CROWD</td><td>20.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>01.04.2022</td><td>SELL</td><td>12.000 CROWD</td><td>8.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>01.05.2022</td><td>BUY</td><td>4.000 CROWD</td><td>12.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>User B:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>BUY/SELL</strong></td><td><strong>Amount</strong></td><td><strong>Total</strong></td></tr><tr><td>02.03.2022</td><td>BUY</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>User A bought again in May after selling his CROWD in April. As a result, this user receives his participation, since he owns 12,000 CROWD. The order is now:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td><strong>Buying date</strong></td><td><strong>User</strong></td><td><strong>CROWD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>02.03.2022</td><td>User B</td><td>100.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>01.05.2022</strong></td><td>User A</td><td>12.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Staking, transferring or providing liquidity does not count as SALE. These actions can be easily tracked on the blockchain.</p>



<p>As there is still a lot of time until the deadline, it makes sense to join the long-term holders now.</p>



<h2 id="Long-termholder-english-PricePools">Price Pools</h2>



<p>There are two winning pools, both of them holding 500,000 CROWD.</p>



<p>From the first pool a user will win the exact sum of CROWD tokens he is holding, but a maximum of 25,000 CROWD. If each position has at least 25,000 CROWD, the pool size will last until and including the 20<sup>th</sup> place. However, if there are some users among the winners who hold less than 25,000 CROWD, then a maximum of 100% of the tokens will be distributed. This will then result in more places falling into this part of the prices. If the last position from the first price pool (500,000 CROWD) can no longer receive 25K or 100%, the CROWD will be taken from the second pool.</p>



<p>After having depleted all CROWD from the first pool, follow-up positions will be rewarded from the second pool (again containing 500,000 CROWD). Everyone can receive a maximum of 12,500 CROWD or 50% of their held tokens. The last position still gets the full profit, even if the CROWD tokens (total 1 Mio CROWD) have already been distributed.</p>



<p>Here are some examples for the last places of the two price pools:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td><strong>Incentive</strong></td><td><strong>Spilled CROWD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-19</td><td>25.000 CROWD</td><td>475.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>10.000 CROWD</td><td>485.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>25.000 CROWD</td><td>510.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In this example, only 15,000 CROWD remain for rank 21 from prize pool 1. However, the prize is 25,000 CROWD so the remaining 10,000 CROWD are deducted from prize pool 2. This leaves 490,000 CROWD available for prize pool 2.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td><strong>Incentive</strong></td><td><strong>Spilled CROWD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>22-60</td><td>12.5000 CROWD</td><td>475.000 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>12.500 CROWD</td><td>482.500 CROWD</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>12.500 CROWD</td><td>495.000 CROWD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Rank 62 is the last to receive an allocation of 12,500 CROWD. However, only 7,500 CROWD are still available from prize pool 2. If this happens, we will increase the total number of CROWD tokens so that the prices can be paid out in full.</p>



<p>If you have any further questions, please send them to our community managers. We will then integrate them into this document.</p>



<p>We wish you all good luck with this incentive. Long-term FTW!</p>

First of all, I want to thank the team and the community for their great support during the auction. Each of you who helped in any way or took part in the auction conduced to the success of the auction. This symbolizes what excels the CROWD. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have created a market for the CROWD token on Uniswap and our staking platform is already generating rewards for the stakers. This is a huge step forward &#8211; and an essential one regarding our CCLP feature that, without the CROWD token, would have no fuel for the forthcoming ride. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not everything went as expected. Many pitfalls had to be accepted, imponderables had to be dealt with. Regarding the outcome of the auction, we would have funded even more if some of these conditions had shifted in our favor. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users encountered and are still encountering different kinds of problems along the way of taking part in the auction or claiming their tokens. Decentralized platforms will, and that is what we believe in, change the future. But we had to find out that the whole ecosystem is not yet ready for it. Although we tested the auction platform deeply, we were not able to check its functionality on every single device. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market situation </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some days before the auction, the crypto market recovered following Bitcoin’s pump from USD 35.000 to almost USD 45.000. It looked as if the fear would vanish bit by bit. This is usually a good prerequisite for any public sale. But let’s face the truth. The circumstances at the beginning of the auction were not great. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conflict between Russia and Ukraine did not help either. Fear and uncertainty spread panic in many financial markets and the crypto space has not unglued from the traditional markets yet. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auction participants </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a great experience for us to see so many newcomers take part in the auction and thus indicate their belief in CrowdSwap. And yes, I have to admit that we did not make it easy to participate: Transfers to wallets, swapping coins and tokens, importing the correct tokens to the wallet and doing cross-chain transfers &#8211; for many, these preparations were difficult to overcome. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked to hundreds of people before and during the auction and tried to support each of them individually. What pleased me enormously: Nobody that I talked to gave up even if it took hours to get into the auction! And in the end, everyone made it! </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, questions about our marketing strategy have come up. We prepared for the auction teaming up with high potential international influencers on Twitter, YouTube and TikTok, we offered Community Engagement, registered in ICO listings and presented our project on highly frequented pages. A lot of the aforementioned turned out to be scams or offers to lack in substance. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we have to say that our German YouTube friends did an extraordinary job. We are very grateful for your support before and during the public sale and we are excited about the upcoming years of our collaboration. Thank you very much! </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The essence is that you can only rely on decent contacts. This we will keep in mind for our marketing strategy in the next months. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back on track </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the auction is before cross-chain liquidity protocol (CCLP)! </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ve learned from the auction is that there is a prevalent need for an easy cross-chain solution. The good news is: We are working on it as you are reading these words. We are looking forward to building a better cross-chain experience. Any opportunity should be easy to take. Our best-price-routing will be taken to the next level of market comparison. No other project offers a comparable feature at the moment! </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there is a lot left to learn and we embrace this way of learning, adjusting and implementing to end up succeeding. I personally learned that our CROWD community is strong enough to overcome pitfalls like this. I am proud of all of you who participated in the auction and supported and continue to support CrowdSwap. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best regards </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian</span></p>						</div>

There are many methods from a classical business valuation to apply. However, to begin with, I will concentrate on the revenue-based model. Revenue (before interest and taxes) is a parameter that can be easily determined and extrapolated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For example, a popular model is to calculate valuation using &#8220;multiples&#8221;. Here, the turnover is multiplied by a so-called sector multiple. The result shows the value of the company based on revenue. However, revenue alone does not make up the valuation. Other values are included here, which we might look at another time.</span></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The point here is how projects use their revenue. After deducting interest and taxes, what remains is the profit, which flows back into the project. How is the profit used? Is it reinvested in the project to achieve or secure more significant benefits in the future? Or is the profit distributed to the stakeholders? In other words, it&#8217;s about how much money is going into growth and value. And that is precisely where the valuation of the CROWD token comes in.</span></p>						</div>

							<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">CrowdSwap realizes its revenue through fees on swaps. The &#8220;earning fees&#8221; are collected in a smart contract and then distributed into three areas, as shown in the diagram.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0px;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-indent: -18pt; letter-spacing: 0px;">1. Invest in the project</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After the &#8220;token genesis event&#8221; (TGE), the project has an enormous amount of tokens. These tokens, if they are not immediately needed to pay for expenses in the project or provided for market liquidity, are put into staking. (Before staking is set up, all turnover flows back into the project).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When the revenue is distributed (after interest and taxes), 70% flows into the staking. The percentage of the staking pool held by the project goes back into the project, and 100% is reinvested in growing CrowdSwap. The goal is to continuously improve the capabilities of our team, the app, and the marketing to increase market share (revenue).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0px;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-indent: -18pt; letter-spacing: 0px;">2. Staking</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The project itself is, of course, not the only staker. Every holder of CROWD tokens is allowed to store CROWD token in the CrowdSwap Staking and thereby earn interest. The respective share in the staking pool defines the share of 70% of the revenue. The more tokens remain in the staking, the fewer are available for trading. The vested amount of tokens stabilizes the price of the CROWD token.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0px;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-indent: -18pt; letter-spacing: 0px;">3. Treasury</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The remaining 30% of the turnover (after interest and taxes) is divided between the areas of &#8220;burn&#8221; and &#8220;liquidity&#8221;, which I do not want to go into detail here. Merely this much that the funds from this area are used to maintain the value of the token. &#8220;Burn&#8221; has a deflationary effect on the token, &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; is used without exception for investments in the project. All funds that have not been used from these areas go directly into &#8220;Treasury&#8221;. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The funds in &#8220;Treasury&#8221; are invested in a basket of different cryptocurrencies.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We have identified a small but important factor in the valuation of the CROWD token, which currently accounts for a small proportion of the token&#8217;s value. However, it will grow exponentially over time. For the CrowdSwap project, this is an essential part of securing value.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we take a close look at the distribution of the complete turnover (after interest and taxes), all components of the use of revenue deliver an increase in the value of the CROWD token. Here are all of them again in summary:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Burn</b>: Reduces the number of max supply. Increases the value of the token price.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Liquidity</b>: Reinvested in the project for growth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Staking</b>: Great incentive to stake CROWD tokens and profit from the success of CrowdSwap.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Project</b> Staking: Share of revenue that flows back into the project and is reinvested for further growth.</span></p>

<p class="graf graf--p">The community will profit from these factors the most. That´s what have in mind for CrowdSwap.</p>

							<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; ; letter-spacing: 0px;">In recent months, AAVE has often shown that the fundamentally strong project can also shine with price gains. And this is always the case when Ethereum is being outperformed. The first time this really happened was in mid-January 2021.</span></p><p>Anyone who switched from Ethereum to AAVE at that time and back again just under a month later would now have three times the amount of Ethereum. Not bad, for one month.</p><p>From the chart, we can clearly see the zone when a switch from Ethereum to AAVE made sense in the past. At around 0.11 ETH per AAVE, there was always at least a 50% reaction in the shortest time.</p><p>Currently, the price of Aave in Ethereum is again exactly at this zone and just below a downward trend line. A break of this trendline could catapult the price significantly upwards again. For now, however, a dip into the accumulation zone is also possible, as momentum is clearly on Ethereum based on the latest news.</p><p>In my view, the path of the money supports the thesis that an exchange of Ethereum into Aave offers a good risk-reward ratio, as investments are first made in Bitcoin, then in Ethereum (or &#8220;big alts&#8221;) and finally in the remaining alts (this then also includes AAVE).<br />Whether this will happen in the next few days or weeks? No one can predict that. However, the past shows that AAVE was always a buy at this price.</p><p>Find the best price for swapping ETH to AAVE and save up to 30% here: <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/search?source=ETH&amp;target=AAVE">https://app.crowdswap.org/search?source=ETH&amp;target=AAVE</a></p><p>Right now AAVE is in accumulation terrain.

							<p>Solving existing Crypto challenges like</p><ul><li>High transaction fees</li><li>Complexity</li><li>User-friendliness</li><li>Transparency</li></ul><p>is essential for the future and acceptance of DeFi. CrowdSwap is confident that these can be improved or solved with <a href="//web/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CrowdSwap technologies</a>.</p><h3>Best-Price-Routing – why? And what does it mean?</h3><h3> </h3><p>The Search App searches for the best price for a specific token pair in the complete DeFi Space. The search takes place cross-chain and is only limited by the integration of the different DEXes. The best-price algorithm finds the best price for the token pair and considers all collateral costs. These costs are:</p><ul><li>Fees of the DEXes </li><li>Transaction costs of the execution of the smart contracts (swap)</li><li>Prices of the bridge transfer (network transfer).</li></ul><p> The best price per token, including all collateral costs, is created and presented to the user in ascending order. The determination of the price bases on the following formula:</p><p><em>𝑃𝑃</em><em>(</em><em>𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎</em><em>)</em><em>𝑡𝑡</em><em> =   M(p + F) + C / M</em></p><p>The total cost price of a DEX is calculated from the number of tokens M multiplied by the token price p, added by the fees F of the DEX. The total is added by the cost C of the transactions for executing the smart contracts. Price per token is the result divided by the number of M.</p><p>The number of tokens M is determined from the exchange volume underlying the search. By default, this is set to $500 but can be changed in the settings. The number of tokens is equal to the quotient of exchange volume V and price added with fees.</p><p><em>𝑀</em> <em>=  V / p + F</em></p><p>Where f is the product of price and fees as a percentage.</p><p><em>𝐹</em><em> = </em><em>𝑝</em> <em>∗</em> <em>𝑓</em><em>%</em></p><p>The Best-Price-Routing search result display presents the user with <strong>a clear ranking reduced to price</strong> and shows the number of tokens the user will receive after an exchange to the exchange volume. Furthermore, the user can view price details for each total price to understand the pricing.</p><p>Many DEXes use different functions of their smart contracts to execute the same TokenSwaps. Here, the internal routing is not always the same, resulting in higher transaction costs for the user. <strong>CrowdSwap analyzes the smart contracts of the connected DEXes and always executes the swap via the most lucrative and shortest path.  </strong></p><p>In addition to the price, the user also sees the percentage of ancillary costs in the swap volume. The overall price per token (including all ancillary costs) allows the user to quickly decide <strong>which DEX is the most efficient for the desired swap. </strong></p><p>CrowdSwap determines the transaction costs by an empirical analysis of the on-chain data. Here, the mean values of all functions&#8217; gas consumption are determined and multiplied by the calculation&#8217;s current gas costs.</p><p>G = current gas cost</p><h3>It´s all about Transparency</h3><h3> </h3><p>Most DEXes focus on swapping from token A to token B based on their liquidity pools. CrowdSwap Best-Price-Routing (BPR) emphasizes transparency of the best route for the swap, the fee structure, and the swap side costs. </p><p>The best route for the swap is not always the one that the DEXes suggest as the best price. <strong>Many transactions of arbitrage traders show that there are more optimal routes in certain market phases</strong>, which have the most significant advantages for the user. </p><p>CrowdSwap transparently <strong>displays all routes of the compared DEXes</strong>. The best price algorithm ensures that the best route of each DEX is found. The goal is <strong>always the best price, including all additional costs.</strong> No other criteria, such as pool ratio, pool health, volume or TVL, play a role. Our focus is exclusively on the price advantage of our users.</p><h3>Why and how did we get there?</h3><h3> </h3><p>The fee structure is not always easy to understand. While the DEXes display the fees, they are usually shown in token form rather than US dollars. These numbers bring confusion as to the magnitude of the costs. For swaps over multiple LPs, the fees of 0.3%, for example, accrue numerous times. I.e., for a value of 1000$ over two LPs there is not 3$ but 6$. It also happens that different pools charge different fees. In the new V3 of Uniswap the prices go from 0.05% &#8211; 1%, depending on the pool. CrowdSwap always displays the fees of the swap in US dollars to be compared to each other.</p><p>The swap charges are not displayed on most DEXes because they are a network problem and not of the DEXes themselves. We agree with this only to the extent that it makes no difference on a DEX. However, if the user can choose, he would probably use the exchange platform with the lowest incidental costs. </p><p>Concerning the ancillary costs, we will only assume the transaction costs here. Considerable differences can arise due to different smart contracts. Furthermore, the tokens involved also influence the gas costs and thus on the transaction costs. Optimizing smart contracts can therefore lead to significant savings. Providers are working on this with varying degrees of success.</p><p>However, it is not always the case that the DEX with the higher ancillary costs also always have a worse price after CrowdSwap representation. Sometimes the pure swap prices are so reasonable that even higher ancillary costs still achieve the best overall price. So we take all costs into account to make sure the user is paying the best price per token.</p><p>With the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best-Price-Routing Search App</a> CrowdSwap shows maximum transparency when comparing the best routes of different DEXes. The prices of the DEXes have been created based on the best routes from a provider perspective. On-Chain data analysis provides the exact ancillary transaction costs based on historical gas costs for the swaps across the routes shown. If CrowdSwap finds a better route, it offers an additional entry in the search results.</p>						</div>

							<p>In the last two weeks there have been some far-reaching changes in the CrowdSwap project. First, we are constantly working on improvements to the app itself, which is currently already available in beta version at <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org">https://app.crowdswap.org</a> and can of course be used. In the beta version, there are also no additional fees for our best-price routing.</p><p>But back to the highlights: First, CrowdSwap&#8217;s swap app has been significantly improved once again and is now on par with the usability of the best-price search app. Further improvements at this point are planned in the area of token selection: Not only will more tokens be whitelisted and the display of these significantly improved, in the future the management of tokens will also become easier.</p><p>In addition to the clear display of the tokens to be traded, you will also always receive an overview of the fees and incidental costs of the swap. Small but subtle improvements always contribute to better usability. If you have any comments, please submit them via Telegram or Discord. We are always happy to receive constructive feedback.</p><h3><strong>Are AMMs better than decentralized order books?</strong></h3><p>CrowdSwap has always been committed to transparency in the price/cost jungle. Therefore, it is also obvious that we are looking for more solutions to offer token swaps to our users at a lower cost than via AMMs.</p><p>AMMs are no longer necessarily the best choice when it comes to liquidity exchanges in the DeFi sector for several reasons. In addition to the fees incurred by LPs, AMM-based transactions can also be easily exposed to attacks. See MEV Protection!</p><p>CrowdSwap aims to provide MEV Protection on the Swap App and explore other swap options that secure benefits of our users. Currently we are analyzing the possibilities of creating a decentralized order book that accepts limit orders and only executes them if there is a match. This means that no transaction costs are incurred when an order is created. These are only due when the order is actually filled. This then results in a transaction on the blockchain of the respective network. Using this approach, the fees of LPs of min. 0.3% can also be significantly reduced. For LPs, on the other hand, this approach eliminates the so-called &#8220;impermanent loss&#8221;. Large order volumes can be executed at low slipage conditions, similar to OTC trading of the central exchanges. Most order matching will be P2P or ring trades, which are inexpensive to map.</p><p>So there are a lot of new topics coming up for CrowdSwap. Feel free to discuss these and other topics with us on Discord. We&#8217;ll keep you posted on this and other topics. </p><p>In the last two weeks there have been some far-reaching changes in the CrowdSwap project.

							<p>The trading of cryptocurrencies in so-called decentralized financial markets (DeFi) based on blockchains and smart contracts is rapidly growing into a new form of global finance via the nearly 70 decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (so-called DEXes). Already, about 2,000 cryptocurrencies or coins/tokens are traded on crypto exchanges &#8211; with a daily turnover of about USD 5 billion, on some days up to USD 10 billion. In the last 6 years alone, the crypto market grew by 45 000%; 450% since last May.</p><p><strong>A big problem in the crypto market</strong> today is the <strong>lack of transparency</strong> regarding the different transaction costs in the various DEXes and the lack of insight about in the fair price of a cryptocurrency in the respective crypto exchange.</p><p>Especially for beginners, this can mean that they have to pay <strong>up to 100% more for an exchange</strong> in cryptocurrencies than necessary. Even for experienced DeFi traders, it is <strong>almost impossible to get an overview with reasonable effort</strong> to get the best price for their swap.</p><p>The German startup CrowdSwap now solves this problem. It was founded by a mixed software developer team of Germans and Iranians. They are familiar with blockchain projects in the German energy industry and have spent a year developing <strong>best price routing blockchain technology</strong>.<br />With their system, which incorporates both cryptocurrency prices and associated transaction costs, they aim to bring more transparency to the burgeoning global crypto market.</p><p>Transparency is also the thread that runs through the professional life of (?) entrepreneur Christian Mülder, software developer, stock market trader and investor, and Blockchain is the 100% tool what makes this possible. Back in 2006, he was a co-initiator in the open source project B2B By Practice. The software is used by 60% of all German energy providers and implements the communication and mapping of processes of the German energy market using blockchain-like technology. His first company, which he sold in 2016, enabled him to start as a trader and investor, and for him it was obvious from his own experience that transparency in the crypto market urgently needed to be established: &#8220;I was supposed to pay transaction costs of USD 100 when exchanging a coin worth USD 500. This was not disclosed to me on the exchange. 20% in incidental investment costs is not acceptable. This gave me the idea to develop a price comparison for cryptocurrencies with my old peers,&#8221; Mülder said.</p><p>CrowdSwap is going live in early June 2021 with its crypto price comparison app in a beta version, available for exchanges of the 2,000 major cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum network on initially 5 of the major DEXes. <strong>Traders can compare crypto prices, swap directly across different DEXes, and CrowdSwap promises an average of 20-30% cost savings</strong> when swapping cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In doing so, CrowdSwap displays 100% transparent all prices and costs that await a crypto trader and calculates the total price a trader has to pay for a currency swap.</p><p>In the beta phase, CrowdSwap itself does not charge any fees; however, they are already displayed in the price comparison.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href="/web">/web</a> &#8211; or compare prices and swap coins directly here: <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.crowdswap.org</a>:</p><p>Contact:<br />Christian Mülder<br />CrowdSwap<br />c/o Dreamrockz GmbH<br />Willowstr. 20<br />53562 St. Catherine<br />presse@crowdswap.org<br />June 1, 2021 </p>						</div>
