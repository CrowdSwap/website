<h2 id="h-what-is-daily-compound-interest">What is daily compound interest?</h2>



<p>The incredible growth of crypto-currencies lately had the world believe in the importance of investing in this wholly new and profitable world. Currently, the concern of financial risks has given its place to finding and choosing the best investment method. Whereas most investors do not have specific knowledge about types of interests and how much money they can earn with less effort. Compound interest has helped many people meet their goals and go beyond their financial targets. Yet, the concept is still vogue to some people. Since comprehending and applying this strategy make the crypto world more exciting for investors, we will discuss compound interest&#8217;s aspects.</p>



<h2 id="h-compound-vs-simple-interest">Compound vs. Simple Interest</h2>



<p>After depositing money into a financial system, you expect to earn interest rewards. Interests are divided into two main types. Simple and compound. To understand both concepts clearly, starting with simple interest is a good idea.</p>



<h3 id="h-simple-interest">Simple interest</h3>



<p>By the name itself, it is short and steady interest. Simple interest refers to the earned interest on the actual money deposited. Let&#8217;s discuss it through examples. If you invest $100 as the principal amount at the rate of 5% per year, by the end of the year, you have earned $5. It means it is calculated by multiplying the principal by the given rate. In this example, 100 multiplied by 5% equivalents 5. The critical point is the original money invested stays fixed, and each year you will earn $5. Take a look at this formula to learn how to calculate simple interest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="366" height="149" src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12820" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1.png 366w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></figure>



<h3 id="h-compound-interest">Compound interest</h3>



<p>Contrary to simple interest, compound interest is not based on a fixed basis. Although it is a helpful method, the concept seems complicated to users. Learning the compound interest strategy is suitable for those who are aware of the constant pump and dump of the crypto market and are not easily fooled by the tricks of the whales. The only key to applying it is to be patient.</p>



<p>Explaining through example, consider a snowball. Suppose you are standing on top of a snow hill and a small snowball is in your hands. Now, a slight push is enough for this snowball to fall from the top of the mountain to the entire slope.</p>



<p>Along the way, the snowball gets bigger and bigger. By the time it reaches the ground, it has multiplied in size! In this example, if you rush to spend, you will get a small snowball or eventually double, but the passage of time and a lot of patience will reward the patient investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compound Interest is calculated according to the principal and profits of the previous periods. For example, you enter cryptocurrency trading with $100 and add your monthly profit to the principal amount. Through this method, the profit from your property will increase exponentially. This investment method has a faster growth rate than simple interest. Simple interest is a fixed amount assigned to your initial amount invested, but compound interest accounts for your monthly profits and the principal. With this strategy, your investment will multiply in a few years.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-calculate-compound-interest">How to calculate compound interest?</h2>



<p>One of the common mistakes of traders is entering the crypto-currency trading market without sufficient knowledge and information. The growing interest in the crypto market and the introduction of new cryptocurrencies draw people&#8217;s attention to investing. But, when starting, these people forget the importance of investment strategies. A group enters this risky field with only their life capital, and another group buys a new cryptocurrency without knowing the market. Do not forget that calculating the rate of return on investment is one of the essential things a trader or investor interested in crypto should pay attention to. Here is the daily compound interest formula:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="383" height="246" src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12821" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2.png 383w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>A = final amount</p>



<p>P = initial principal balance</p>



<p>r&nbsp; = interest rate</p>



<p>n = number of times interest applied per period</p>



<p>t&nbsp; = number of periods elapsed.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s discuss it with an example. Suppose you deposit $10000 to the annual rate of 5%. According to this chart, after ten years, you will end up with around $15000. You can calculate your interest rate using the compound interest formula. The formula is as follows:</p>



<p>P = 10000</p>



<p>r&nbsp; = 5%</p>



<p>n = 1</p>



<p>t&nbsp; = 10</p>



<p>A = 10000 (1 + 0.05 / 1) (1× 10) = 16,288.95</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Course length</strong></td><td><strong>The amount of profit based on the rate of 5%</strong></td><td><strong>Profit calculation</strong></td><td><strong>Amount of capital Ultimate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>First year</td><td>$500</td><td>$10,500</td><td><strong>$10,000 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Second year</td><td>$525</td><td>$11,025</td><td><strong>$10,500 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Third year</td><td>$551.25</td><td>$11,576.25</td><td><strong>$11,025 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Fourth year</td><td>$578.81</td><td>$12,155.06</td><td><strong>$11,576.25 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Fifth year</td><td>$607.75</td><td>$12,762.82</td><td><strong>$12,155.06 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Sixth year</td><td>$638.14</td><td>$13,400.96</td><td><strong>$12,762.82 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Seventh year</td><td>$670.05</td><td>$14,071</td><td><strong>$13,400.96 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Eighth year</td><td>$703.55</td><td>$14,774.55</td><td><strong>$14,071 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Ninth year</td><td>$738.73</td><td>$15,513.28</td><td><strong>$14,774.55 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>10th year</td><td>$775.66</td><td>$16,288.95</td><td><strong>$15,513.28 x 5%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-compound-daily-interest-and-defi">Compound Daily Interest and DeFi</h2>



<p>To see how compound interest works with DeFi, consider staking crypto. As mentioned above, reinvesting the rewards rather than paying them out is the result. Every time you make a reward with tokens, put it back into the staking pool. The next time you will start earning a profit on the initial principal deposited plus reinvested interests into the smart contract. Notably, since the staking profits are daily, each day, you can make compound interest exponentially. By the end of the year, you can gain more profit than you aimed to have with a simple interest-earning strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-daily-compound-interest-in-crowdswap">Daily Compound Interest in CrowdSwap</h2>



<p>Now we all know earning compound interest comes in handy for users to apply. Since CrowdSwap concentrates on simplifying DeFi investments, we provide a built method to make a simple but desirable outcome for users. Thorugh <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">opportunities</a> service, compound profit (based on APY), and daily interest are defined specifically, ready for you to choose your investing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-you-do-the-math">You do the math!</h2>



<p>Earning profit from crypto-currency trading has different strategies, and each person desires to be a part of this market. While traders are busy with their short and long trades, those who are intelligent and patient own the most profit. Pay attention to the upward trend of the value in the last few years! Someone who has neglected his $1,000 profit has already pocketed millions in capital.</p>

<h2 id="h-defi-staking-vs-yield-farming">DeFi Staking vs. Yield Farming</h2>



<p>When it comes to decentralized finances, two concepts cross minds. The first one is staking, and the second one is yield farming. Both terms are somehow similar but not the same. After reading this article, you can define the difference between these two ways of investing money in the DeFi world, and also, you are going to be able to choose which one suits you and you prefer more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-staking-crypto">What Is Staking crypto?</h2>



<p>As we all know, based on <em><a href="https://crowdswap.org/what-is-staking-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a></em>, staking crypto is a way of investing tokens in DeFi platforms and earning them back through liquidity pools. It is also known as earning passive income, which means the only thing that an investor should do is to put tokens into a staking app, sign a smart contract and then sit back and watch earned benefits transferred into their wallets. Staking crypto is considered a low-risk investment based on decentralized systems and has been proven very popular lately.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-yield-farming-crypto">What is Yield Farming crypto?</h2>



<p>Put, yield farming is a process to boost returns in DEX (Aka decentralized exchanges.) Crypto users can use a DeFi platform to earn the most reward from investing tokens. Yield farmers can loan, borrow, and stake tokens or coins to earn boosted rewards in return. Here we are going to discuss each way of yield farming relatively.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-staking">Staking&nbsp;</h3>



<p>One way to farm yields is to stake. Through staking, a stakeholder can generate rewards from a liquidity pool provided by the liquidity provider, the platform in which the smart contract and pools are prepared for investors to sign and stake. This way, stakeholders supply a liquidity pool with the significantly earned tokens from the same pool they have already invested in. In other words, when someone earns benefits from staking crypto, they put rewarded tokens and coins again, and LPs (liquidity providers) choose to reward them in return. In this case, they will earn twice as much.</p>



<h3 id="h-crypto-loans-lend-and-borrow-cryptos">Crypto loans: lend and borrow cryptos</h3>



<p>In this case, investors can loan coins or tokens through Defi and become a lender. The benefit of this way is that the holder can yield farm from the interest of the loaned amount. They lend to borrowers via smart contracts in the DEX system. On the other hand, crypto borrowers can also have a good opportunity in yield farming; simultaneously, when they hold the loan, they will also earn benefits from the interest rate of tokens. In addition, when a holder using DeFi protocols lends tokens, they exchange tokens with borrowers; the exchange rate is constantly increasing. So, when they exchange their tokens, they will be more than the original amount. In other words, they will receive the equivalent number of tokens plus the exchange rate benefit. Crypto loans can be a reward for both lenders and borrowers. So, do the math—easy benefit for all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-yield-farming-safety-and-risks">Yield Farming Safety and Risks</h2>



<p>As the term speaks for itself, risks in the crypto-currency world are inevitable. But, can the risks of yield farming be calculated? It is better to divide risks into two parts to answer this question. The crystal-clear part depends on the market and regulations in no one’s control, such as volatility and impermanent loss. The second risk section is what the DeFi platform is responsible for, like rug pulls and smart contract hacks. Discussing the risks and safety of yield farming in detail can be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-volatility">Volatility</h3>



<p>Not only DeFi platforms but also all assets experience volatility. Whether benefit from it or being harmed. Volatility refers to security liability change rates both ways; in a period, a price can rise or fall rapidly and unpredictably. So, it indeed may affect yield farming, too. It is not something for an investor to be scared of but should be alert and put into account.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-impermanent-loss">Impermanent Loss</h3>



<p>As aforementioned, holders deposit tokens in liquidity pools in DeFi staking or yield farming; during volatility, LPs and investors may experience impermanent loss. A liquidity pool is constantly exposed to this risk. It happens when the price of a token in the pool changes. As a result, the value of assets is affected. The price may go both wards; either rise or fall. Again, it is not an issue that LPs are responsible for.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-rug-bulls">Rug Bulls</h3>



<p>When new projects are aroused, scammer developers try to attract investors to participate in the scam project; before the project is built, they close it without giving them any interest. So, vulnerable investors are left with no money. It is a big fraud that any staking crypto or yield farming user should be aware of. Gladly, CrowdSwap can provide security and safety for investors participating in DeFi projects. If you want to invest money, consider CrowdSwap a reliable and secure platform. We assure you there is no need to worry about this risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-smart-contract-hacks">Smart Contract Hacks</h3>



<p>Since DeFi staking crypto and yield farming are available via smart contracts, they can be critical to holders and hackers. And also, because coding cannot be bugless, the bugs can harm holders’ wallets and be spotted by hackers. CrowdSwap developing team is doing its best to secure investors’ wallets and prepare a safe and sound platform for its users to experience earning money with no worries.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency-staking-or-yield-farming">How to invest in cryptocurrency?&nbsp; Staking or yield farming</h2>



<p>Now that both DeFi staking and yield farming are clarified, it is time to compare them briefly. In the decentralized finance world, these two terms are close but not equivalent; they provide opportunities for investors to benefit from their investments. Also, on some levels, they may have similar approaches, such as using DeFi-based platforms, available via smart contract, and earning passive income. Still, they indeed have radical differences in substances. Staking provides a less risky protocol for investors, while yield farming is a riskier way of earning interests.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the benefit amount is usually vice-versa. Farmers experience more benefits rather than stakeholders. But the point is that staking crypto has a long-term approach while yield farming is short-term. To put a quick picture in your mind, take a glimpse at the table below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">DeFi Staking</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Yield Farming</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Long-term benefit</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Short-term benefit</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Low-risk</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Almost risky</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Less benefit</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Boosted benefit</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-yield-farming-and-staking-platform">CrowdSwap yield farming and staking platform</h2>

<h2 id="h-what-is-defi-staking-about" style="line-height:3">What is Defi staking about?</h2>



<p>Nowadays, you can hear about this brand-new financial term in every crypto-related environment, but “what is DeFi and DeFi staking really about?” Although it is popular these days, it remains a vague concept. Of course, there is a reason that all of the attention is drawn to this very subject since it is overgrowing and changing many basic rules radically, such as types of investments, loans, and paybacks.<br>So, before going through staking crypto, it is better first to clarify what is Defi; then how staking works Defi-wise. It was back to the birth of the Bitcoin blockchain. As we all know, BTC has come to life to decentralize transactions, so this issue is based on blockchain. The first goal of its foundation is to omit intermediaries, which leads to a desirable result: you do not need to go through the KYC procedure through this new but basic idea of crypto-currency. By reading this article, we will give you a bright and clear image of its nature and function in your mind.</p>



<h2 id="h-defi-staking-and-its-features">Defi Staking and Its Features</h2>



<p>Now that the meaning of Defi is clarified, it is time to see how staking crypto works. When it comes to earning money from the crypto-currency world, three main ways cross everyone’s mind: Mining, holding, and staking. Although staking crypto is about generating money, it is different from mining, while it is similar to holding on some levels. To understand the meaning of this term deeply, it can be a good idea to compare it with the holding way. To hold means to buy a coin and wait for the coin to increase its value. Staking crypto is to commit the crypto assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. It can take place with those crypto-currencies which use the proof-of-stake model to process payments. In this way, one can take the profit out of investing their money in specific cryptos and earn staking rewards. </p>



<p>It is a passive way of generating income. In staking crypto, you should buy those crypto-currencies which use the proof-of-stake model and then transfer and lock them into your blockchain wallet. After investing specific tokens, you should join a liquidity pool, a tool in which stakeholders combine their tokens. They get rewards with tokens of the same block. The next step is the best one; earning the mentioned passive income. When stakeholders invest their money in a liquidity pool, they get rewards with tokens from the pool in their wallets. So, isn’t it a good idea to consider staking crypto easy money right in your pocket?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-staking-crypto-work">How does staking crypto work?</h2>



<p>As aforementioned, one can be rewarded tokens as they lock their cryptos into a blockchain wallet. Staking crypto can be the decentralized version of the traditional deposit and earning profit system. The same as the traditional system, Defi staking provides opportunities like borrowing, lending, and earning interest. That’s why it is a revolution in financial systems.<br>To see how Defi staking functions, stakeholders need to acknowledge some conditions and tools, like the smart contract, platform, and liquidity pool. As mentioned before, transactions take place through a smart contract in which conditions of contract such as the period of locking crypto in blockchain wallet and the leverage of profit-taking are determined.<br>Also, DeFi staking is available on platforms that provide a liquidity pool in which tokens are combined for stakeholders. The greater the pool, the lower risk of volatility.<br></p>



<h2 id="h-benefits-of-staking-crypto">Benefits of Staking crypto</h2>



<p>Since intermediaries are eliminated through decentralization, and smart contracts are provided in platforms, from this point of view, DeFi staking has benefits for stakeholders like:<br><br>• Minimal need for attention compared to holding<br>• Low risk of crypto value decrease<br>• Safety and security of staked crypto via smart contract<br>• Lower risk rather than trading since no specialized skill is needed<br>• Almost no charging fees for transactions</p>



<h2 id="h-risks-of-staking-crypto">Risks of Staking crypto</h2>



<p>Like all other financial systems staking crypto might come across with some risks. However, compared to other crypto-based activities, the risks are so low. They can be considered the system with the lowest risk. The risks are:<br>• Earning relatively lower profit than expected in trading<br>• The value volatility of cryptos<br>• Inflation rate of crypto-currencies</p>



<h2 id="h-is-staking-crypto-the-same-as-liquidity-pool">Is Staking crypto the same as Liquidity Pool?</h2>



<p>To answer this question, it is better first to review both terms. A liquidity pool is a store where tokens are reserved for decentralized exchanges. However, staking crypto is a way of investing in the crypto world. To be more clarified, check out this example. Imagine you want to try out DeFi. One way is to stake, which now we all know about it. Staking tokens are available through liquidity pools. So, both terms are related but not the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-defi-staking-platform">CrowdSwap DeFi Staking platform</h2>



<p>As noted above, to stake you need a DeFi staking platform. Every crypto-currency trader, whether advanced or not, is looking for an easy and handy way to earn passive income. The good news is that the solution is right away. CrowdSwap provides a user-friendly and good staking platform for stakeholders to stake their CROWD tokens in liquidity pools. You will receive 25% APY CROWD as interest. Then earned CROWD tokens and all the staked initially CROWDs will be transferred in the opposite direction; from the liquidity pool into their wallets. Stakeholders can invest and then sit back and watch. CrowdSwap will save you time and do the rest for you.</p>

<h4 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h4>



<p>On the whole, DeFi staking is an exciting present-day concept that has been proven very popular among crypto-currency environments. Since it can end the traditional financial system and low-risk function with blockchain in the future, it might be a good idea to consider staking crypto in a safe and provident manner to invest and think. Although it is a simple way of earning interest, it is less known in detail among traders and holders; so it will develop soon. </p>
