New users that get started with cross-chain swaps might expect that it is easy to swap one type of token with another across different chains. It is not the case as coins function in different chains and work in a decentralised way. It becomes a challenge to have tokens with different values and on different chains. To get the best value for the tokens, users need a way of moving the tokens across chains. The solution is to perform a cross-chain swap, which is also known as an atomic swap. In this post, we’ll define cross-chain swaps and show why it is important in today’s world. We will also cover some tips to help you get started with cross-chain swaps.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">What is a Cross-chain swap?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cross-chain swap involves the transfer of crypto tokens across different Blockchain networks. The user in one network who wants to get tokens in another network performs the cross-chain swap to get the different tokens on the desired network. This is best achieved using smart contracts, which help users swap crypto. Smart contracts connect to different chains and perform automatic swaps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a user, monitoring different chains to get the best-priced tokens is a challenge. Using smart contracts is the way to go to find the best options to swap crypto. Applications that help execute cross-chain swaps operate on platforms that make the atomic swaps fast and efficient. Some of the best platforms in the market help to swap crypto without limitations, which include the requirement to first submit customer data. This makes your decision to use smart contracts to swap crypto a better decision. Such is the case when comparing the efficiency of crypto swaps with the process of currency exchange in centralised systems.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the prevailing challenges in cross-chain swaps, it offers many benefits to users in DeFi networks. Problems such as the time taken to move tokens across network borders are great hurdles. Using a platform such as CrowdSwap helps to solve these problems and enables you to swap crypto with ease.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">Why are Cross-chain swaps important?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To answer this question, we could look at how a crypto upswing or downswing could affect the value of your tokens. With an upswing, users have an increase in the value of their tokens in one network. The situation might change when a downswing occurs. Tokens can lose value and lead to losses. Cross-chain swaps provide a way of dealing with the volatility of crypto by giving users the chance to move crypto across networks. Users can swap crypto to protect the value of their tokens and the losses that come along with it. An example is to swap volatile crypto with stablecoins, which ensure a lower level of volatility in the market.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits linked to cross-chain swaps extend to the use of crypto in the wider market. If you desire to have tokens in a specific Blockchain network, cross-chain swaps can help you benefit from market opportunities. You can swap tokens with low market circulation to ones with high circulation. This makes it efficient to pay for products and services and to</span><a href="//web/how-to-send-crypto-crowdswap/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">send crypto to other users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the same network. The lack of a chance to swap crypto among users can limit the number of ways of using virtual tokens.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEXes have added functions and benefits to users through cross-chain swaps. After being the first person to perform a cross-chain swap, Charlie Lee pointed to the continued growth of decentralised systems. In the below tweet on his handle, Charlie hinted to users having more power through the use of cross-chain swaps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7440 size-full" style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: var( --e-global-color-astglobalcolor5 );" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/charlie.png" alt="cross-chain swap" width="603" height="414" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/charlie.png 603w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/charlie-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the first crypto swap, smart contracts have continued to increase the efficiency of the crypto swap process.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">CrowdSwap’s Atomic Token Transfer</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the most useful platforms in the market, CrowdSwap provides users with an efficient solution to performing atomic swaps. The platform helps users overcome time and price barriers, which might limit the benefits of cross-chain swaps. The ability to execute a crypto swap on time is necessary as the swap details for the swap change in a matter of seconds. To successfully execute a swap, CrowdSwap uses Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools to ensure crypto swaps occur on time. The figure below shows the use of Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools on the CrowdSwap platform.</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7441 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/crros-chain.png" alt="cross-chain swap" width="624" height="298" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/crros-chain.png 624w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/crros-chain-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to save time is one benefit of using the CrowdSwap platform. Another one is the chance to take advantage of low prices for the selected crypto pairs.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">Tips and reminders for Cross-chain swaps</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some tips and reminders to help you get the most out of cross-chain swaps:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aim to get the best price for the cross-chain swaps. This includes the price of the tokens and any ancillary costs arising from the crypto swap. CrowdSwap’s best price routing feature helps users get the best prices from crypto swaps.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-chain swaps can help to avoid the effects of crypto downswings as users purchase less volatile coins.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms such as CrowdSwap will help you overcome any future crypto swap barriers arising from Blockchain network changes.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, cross-chain swaps help to avoid the barriers of moving coins across different Blockchain networks. In using efficient platforms such as CrowdSwap, you can get the benefit of low prices for cross-chain swaps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="//web/">Get started with CrowdSwap</a> to enjoy the lowest prices for your cross-chain swaps.</span></p>						</div>

							<div><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of DeFi continues to develop and provide new opportunities for users to make profits and grow their investments. Yield farming is one of the recent and popular ways that users can use to make profits. By using smart contracts and liquidity pools, crypto investors can earn attractive returns from their tokens. As the number of yield farmers continues to grow, so does DeFi yield farming also improve. Using smart contracts ensures high levels of transparency as users pool their tokens to earn a return from the investment. In this article, we’ll define yield farming and explain how yield farming works. We’ll also look at why yield farming is important and go over tips to help you with yield farming in your crypto investment journey.</span></div><div> </div><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">What is yield farming?</span></h2><div><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In yield farming, crypto users engage in lending crypto to get returns through interest. Similar to the interest earned on loans from banks, yield farming also enables the yield farmers to earn fees and interest from their tokens. Only that in yield farming, interest and fees come as virtual tokens. DeFi yield farming also takes place in a decentralized environment, which lacks an intermediary. The ability to earn interest works as an incentive for crypto users who have tokens to add to the liquidity pool. A user can continue earning high-value tokens as crypto markets remain stable.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">How does yield farming work?</span></h2><div><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get started with yield farming, let’s go over how the process works. A user can select a yield farming platform. Several platform options are available in the market from which users can make their selection. By using the yield farming platform, one can make a token deposit to a liquidity pool. The liquidity pool brings together different users that add different amounts of tokens to the pool. The liquidity pool is a smart contract that secures all the tokens.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users that benefit from the liquidity pools pay back in fees and interest, which are then paid to the investors. Based on the potential to earn attractive fees and interest, yield farming continues to attract many users. The high number of users affects the amount of interest each user earns from their token deposit to the pool.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield farming in crypto also provides arbitrage opportunities for crypto users. The users are on the lookout to swap their crypto with coins or tokens of a higher value. A platform that helps the user to cross-chain swap their token proves valuable in this case. The volatility of crypto gives the lenders a chance to swap low-value crypto with tokens of a higher value.  </span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">Why is yield farming important?</span></h2><div><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield farming is important, as it is one way that opens DeFi to crypto investors. Users increase the value of tokens they own as they also contribute to the growth of DeFi markets. As a crypto investor, one can earn an annual percentage yield from their token investment. This makes it possible to increase the returns from an initial token investment.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">CrowdSwap’s yield farming opportunities</span></h2><div><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the market-leading platforms, CrowdSwap offers opportunities for lenders involved in yield farming. As users also seek arbitrage opportunities, CrowdSwap can help to identify the token pairs with the highest potential returns. The combination of cross-chain swaps with yield farming crypto opportunities makes CrowdSwap one of the most powerful tools available to investors. The following figure shows yield farming as an opportunity available on the CrowdSwap platform.</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7432 size-full" src="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities.png" alt="yield farming" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="//web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities.png 2560w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities-300x169.png 300w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities-1024x576.png 1024w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities-250x141.png 250w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities-768x432.png 768w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities-1536x864.png 1536w, //web//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_Opportunities-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CrowdSwap platform offers users the chance to benefit from the earning potential emerging in DeFi yield farming. Security and best prices are more features available on the CrowdSwap platform.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 600;">Tips and reminders to yield farming</span></h2><div><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you plan to get started with yield farming, here are a few tips and reminders:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To earn from yield farming, users need a suitable platform that helps to explore the existing investment opportunities. CrowdSwap provides the tools that users need to get started and grow in yield farming.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual percentage yield is an estimated value of returns an investor gains from their token investment in liquidity pools.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risks such as hacker attacks and the volatility of crypto might affect the returns from yield farming. The knowledge of how the risks might affect users’ token investment goes a long way in successful yield farming.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, DeFi yield farming offers users a chance to grow their crypto investments by earning from a token investment into liquidity pools. The rate of return depends on forces in the DeFi space. It also has to do with the participation of other users in the yield farming process, which affects the experience of all users.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get the best experience in yield farming, it’s best to start with a reliable and secure platform such as CrowdSwap.
