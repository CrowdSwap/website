										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earning passive income has always been an exciting way for financial market investors. To earn passive income in the cryptocurrency market, some users search for the most profitable strategies. One of these methods is to put crypto assets into a DeFi protocol. Investors need to know that earning passive income in the cryptocurrency market has its unique characteristics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield, a common term in cryptocurrency that determines how much income you earn from your assets yearly. APY is a measure that helps compare the returns of different platforms. Knowing the concept of APY and how it works in the crypto market is essential for investors. This article thoroughly explains the core ideas behind APY and what it actually means.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-apy-mean">What Does APY mean?</h2>



<p>APY is defined as the annual percentage return on investment, considering a compounded interest rate that grows with your balance. The compound interest rate includes the reward obtained from the initial amount plus the interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investors can gain APY by staking, participating in liquidity pools, and yield farming. DeFi platforms offer various percentages of interest rates by compounding the rewards. This amount is calculated over time and added to the initial balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APY is a financial index that calculates the annual return for a certain amount of asset by using the interest-compounding method. The formula is as follows :</p>



<p>APY = (1 + r/n) ⁿ − 1</p>



<p>Which here:</p>



<p>r = periodic rate of return (or annual APR)</p>



<p>n = number of interest&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s compare simple interest and compound interest with an analogy. Imagine you stake 200 X tokens in Liquidity Pool A, which pays you 6% simple interest after one year. In that case, you can withdraw your initial holdings and a staking bonus consisting of 12 X tokens (6% multiplied by 200 X tokens). After one year of locking 200 X tokens in Liquidity Pool A, you can withdraw 212 X tokens from this pool.</p>



<p>Now imagine that Liquidity Pool B pays you a compound interest of 0.5% per deposit of 200 X tokens. If you deposit your 200 X tokens in Pool B for one year, you can withdraw 212.34 X tokens from this pool at the end of the deposit period. So, a 0.5% compound interest yields roughly the same interest as a 6% simple interest.</p>



<p>Confused, right? That&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s a concept that most people don&#8217;t fully understand the first time. To better grasp this concept, <a href="https://crowdswap.org/what-is-daily-compound-interest/">read our article about compound interest</a>.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s consider a case in point:</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-5-apy-mean">What Does 5% APY Mean?</h2>



<p>APY calculation also depends on the interest compounding period, which is variable. This means that as the figure of interest compounding periods increases, APY also grows.</p>



<p>For example, if you deposit $100,000 at a monthly interest rate of 5%, your APY will be 5.12%, calculated by the formula 100,000 x (1 + 0.05 ÷ 12)^(12). By the end of the year, your balance will be $105,116.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if compounding is daily, your final balance will be $105,127, which means an APY of 5.13%. This number results from the formula 100,000 × (1 + 0.05 ÷ 365)^(365).</p>



<p>Most DeFi platforms calculate the interest every month. Be careful if your APY is 5%, it does not necessarily mean you earn 5% interest per month. The 5% refers to the yearly earning percentage. To calculate monthly interest, take APY and divide it by 12.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-crypto-apy-pros-and-cons">Crypto APY Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>As discussed, APY represents the interest or rate of return you can earn on your assets. Your final earnings will vary depending on how long you lock your coins. Like every other financial index, it has its pros and cons and is affected by many factors.</p>



<p>Like other financial markets, inflation and supply and demand also affect the cryptocurrency market. If a large number of tokens are added to a blockchain network,&nbsp;the asset will reduce in value over time. The more inflation passes the APY rate, the less valuable the earnings will be. Also, the supply-and-demand law affects prices. When the supply is extensive, the interest rate of borrowing money is lower and vice-versa. In addition, market fluctuation results in that AYP will not last forever and will not be a zero-risk method.</p>



<p>On the other hand, noticeable advantages are why annual profit yield is popular among investors. As mentioned above, it is a passive income earned with less effort. So, what is not to like? Plus, although the percentage is calculated yearly, in some platforms, compound interest is calculated daily. Relatively, the investor can withdraw the initial principal plus the earned profit whenever they want. In other words, you will earn APY until you lock your deposit into the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-apy-vs-apr">APY vs. APR?</h2>



<p>APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the interest you gain from your investment in one year and is expressed as a percentage. It may also include interest paid by borrowers in lending platforms. This index helps compare different investment products, for it constructs a consistent basis for determining the annual interest rate.</p>



<p>APY and APR are similar, but there is no interest compounding in APR.</p>



<p>For example, if you stake 10,000 coins with an APR of 10 %, you will earn 1,000 coins after one year, but the APY conditions differ.</p>



<p>The following formula is used to calculate APR :</p>



<p>APR = [( fees + interest ) ÷ P] ÷ n × 365 × 100</p>



<p>where P is the major investment and N is the number of days of the period.</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-s-apy">CrowdSwap&#8217;s APY&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The APY of crypto assets changes constantly and is subject to supply and demand on various protocols. This fluctuation can happen at any moment due to the variable nature of the crypto market. As a DeFi platform, CrowdSwap provides opportunity services with a reasonable APY rate. At the date of this article, on October 18, 2022, CROWD mining offers around 328.37% APY on USDT/CROWD pool for yield farming and 25.00% for CROWD staking. For more information, take a look at the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">Opportunities</a> service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, investors need to acknowledge various methods of depositing and earning to compare options and calculate the profit they may obtain or the risks they may come across. APY is one of the most desirable interest-earning ways in the DeFi ecosystem. By comparing different options in terms of APY, you can choose the best investment opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the introduction of smart contracts, the world of cryptocurrencies saw a significant transformation. It is not an exaggeration to say that smart contracts have revolutionized the growth and development of cryptocurrencies. They showed that the blockchain network is not limited to merely sending and receiving currency and can be used to create and develop complex applications. Modern cryptocurrencies are trying to provide exceptional and exciting services to their users using smart contracts. Binance, considered one of the largest centralized exchanges (CEX), has launched its BNB Smart Chain platform to use all the capabilities of the blockchain network.</p>



<p>BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a platform created by Binance to run applications based on smart contracts. This network works in parallel with the main network of Binance (Binance Chain &#8211; BC) and allows users to use the capabilities of both networks.</p>



<p>In addition, BNB Smart Chain has also implemented Ethereum virtual machine technology in its network. This technology allows the BSC network to run applications based on the Ethereum network, such as MetaMask. The purpose of creating the BSC network is to provide the possibility of developing decentralized applications for developers. Also, this platform helps users to transfer any amount of their assets in the shortest possible time.</p>



<p>Due to its outstanding features, MetaMask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets on the market today. In addition, it can be connected to a wide range of blockchain networks since it is a gateway to the Web 3 ecosystem of dApps. There are many reasons why many users prefer it over other wallets, such as its easy integration, ease of use, and compatibility across different platforms. These are only a few reasons many users prefer it over other wallets. According to Bloomberg, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-20/ethereum-overhaul-risks-creating-a-new-class-of-crypto-kingpins">more than 30 million users</a>, MetaMask is the most popular non-custodial wallet in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-steps-to-add-bsc-to-metamask">Steps to add BSC to MetaMask</h2>



<p>To be able to run dApps on the BNB Smart Chain network, you need first to add the BSC Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet. There are three methods to do it, which we will cover in this article. Before going any further, you will need to download and install MetaMask for Chrome to follow this tutorial. If you need help installing MetaMask, you can read <a href="https://crowdswap.org/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network/">this article</a> and follow steps 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Now, your MetaMask wallet should be connected to BSC Network.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we introduced three methods to add BNB Smart Chain (BSC) to MetaMask. All three are essentially the same, except that entering the data is done automatically for you in the first and second methods. In contrast, in the third method, you must manually enter the same information. Either way, ensure you find the data you want to enter from a reliable source.</p>

<p>CrowdSwap has been busy. After a series of successful projects, now it&#8217;s time to facilitate yield farming BNB Smart Chain (BSC) tokens. With this new feature, CrowdSwap users are now able to seize investment opportunities on the BSC network in no time. Users can short-cut the complex procedure of participating in the CAKE/BNB pool with only a few clicks. </p>



<p>For people who are long-time holders of BNB, finding a way to earn passive income is crucial. That&#8217;s why CAKE/BNB pool is one of the popular yield farming pools out there. However, to participate in those pools, you need to follow a complex process that can be confusing even to experienced users. CrowdSwap has recently launched a feature that can simplify this process to a tremendous amount. So, buckle up; let&#8217;s see how it&#8217;s done. Read more about <a href="https://crowdswap.org/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">ways you can earn passive income during the bear market</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-it-s-typically-done">How it&#8217;s typically done</h2>



<p>Typically, investors who want to participate in the CAKE/BNB pool refer to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/">PancakeSwap</a>. On this DEX, the user has to conduct multiple transactions to get the work done. Imagine you hold some BUSD and want to participate in this pool. In that case, you have to perform the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX1: Swap BUSD for BNB</p>



<p>TX2: Swap BUSD for CAKE</p>



<p>TX3: Add liquidity and receive LP token</p>



<p>TX4: Add LP token to pool</p>



<p>The above four transactions are the typical process of yield farming for cryptocurrency pairs. This is almost the same for all DEXes out there. But what if you could do all the above transactions in one? This feature is now available for CrowdSwap users to help them save a lot of time and effort. Follow along with the article to find out how CrowdSwap facilitates this.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-crowdswap-does-it">How CrowdSwap does it</h2>



<p>CrowdSwap has launched a new feature to shorten the journey of farming CAKE/BNB and make it more exciting through fast-lane transactions. With this feature, you are only a few clicks away from yield farming your tokens. In the above example, if you have BUSD in your wallet, your balance will automatically appear, and you only need to click on &#8220;Allow to use your BUSD.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-9.png" alt="CAKE/BNB yield farming" class="wp-image-12984" width="497" height="426" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-9.png 663w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-9-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /></figure>



<p>After you click this button, your MetaMask wallet will show up, and you will be prompted to confirm the transaction. Once the confirmation is done, you can hit &#8220;Invest,&#8221; and you&#8217;re done. Therefore, a few simple steps can put your assets into a liquidity pool for yield farming. But this does not end here. There&#8217;s another cool feature: cross-chain.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-also-cross-chain">It&#8217;s also cross-chain</h2>



<p>Another fascinating characteristic of this new feature is that it supports cross-chain swaps. This means that if you have tokens on other blockchain networks, you can glide freely between blockchains and participate in another chain&#8217;s opportunities. If you need more information about cross-chain technology, <a href="https://crowdswap.org/cross-chain-technology-unmasking-the-myths/">read this article</a>. Let&#8217;s elaborate on this with a simple example. Imagine you have some Ethereum (ETH) and want to farm CAKE/BNB (done on the BSC network). Typically, you would have to conduct the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX1: Swap ETH&nbsp; (on Ethereum network) for BNB (on BSC network)</p>



<p>TX2: Swap ETH (on Ethereum network) for CAKE (on BSC network)</p>



<p>TX3: Add liquidity (BNB and CAKE) and receive LP token</p>



<p>TX4: Add LP token to pool</p>



<p>Because ETH is on a different network than BNB and CAKE, one needs to do the swap through another procedure and then go back to the actual transactions. But thanks to the cross-chain feature, you have no limitations. This means you don&#8217;t need to swap your ETH to CAKE and BNB first and then put your liquidity in the pool. In fact, the procedure is done precisely as in the BUSD example, as if your ETH is already on the BSC network. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-875x1024.png" alt="CAKE/BNB yield farming" class="wp-image-12985" width="438" height="512" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-875x1024.png 875w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-256x300.png 256w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10-768x899.png 768w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-10.png 1235w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></figure>



<p>Currently, four networks are available on CrowdSwap: Avalanche, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. If you have assets on any of these four blockchains, you can still put your assets in the CAKE/BNB pool. This is done without the need for any excessive swaps. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>



<p>CrowdSwap has made it simpler for its users to use yield farming opportunities on the BSC network. CS users are now able to farm CAKE/BNB without being involved in the cumbersome procedure of swapping tokens. So, everything is done automatically by CrowdSwap for the user, thanks to its meticulous planning. Make sure you <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity/asset">visit this address</a> and conduct your first transaction.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-partners-with-omniaverse-to-take-metaverse-gaming-to-the-next-level"><strong>CrowdSwap partners with OmniaVerse to take metaverse gaming to the next level</strong></h2>



<p>CrowdSwap is proud to announce its partnership with <a href="https://omniaverse.io/">OmniaVerse</a>, a multi-chain platform that allows its users to monetize their artwork using metaverse-supported gaming platforms. Through the support of CrowdSwap, OmniaVerse will be able to add best-price routing and swaps seamlessly to their platform.</p>



<h3 id="h-status-quo"><strong>Status quo</strong></h3>



<p>After the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies, play-to-earn (P2E) games have become commonplace among gamers. Even non-gamers have shown interest in blockchain-based games because of their unique P2E experience. Besides the concentration on NFTs, OmniaVerse wants to integrate a swap functionality for cryptocurrency swaps into their project tokens and future tokens that will launch on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-solution-and-partnership"><strong>The solution and partnership</strong></h3>



<p>CrowdSwap&#8217;s best-price routing and swap feature is one of the most popular features used and appreciated by our community daily. We are excited that Omniaverse will be the first project to natively incorporate this function into their platform via the CrowdSwap API. The API will give Omniaverse&#8217;s community direct access to the supported blockchains Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche. As part of the collaboration, we will continuously expand the functionality of the API. The need for atomic cross-chain swaps already exists and will be essential in a proper multi-chain environment. Cross-chain swaps will be integrated into the API next, allowing Omniaverse to add a seamless multi-chain feeling to its offering automatically.</p>



<p>Best-price routing is based on a meshed graph over the liquidity pools of the respective blockchains. These graphs determine the best routes to the requested coins and tokens. The various prices of the DEXes are then further matched with the swap ancillary costs before a processed ranking is returned to the callers. Price and cost are based on on-chain data that is constantly updated to achieve the best possible result.</p>



<p>Through the CrowdSwap API, projects can natively and easily integrate the benefits of a best-price swap solution into their application, delivering a one-stop user experience to their community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OmniaVerse and CrowdSwap agreed to start a strategic collaboration bringing synergies from different areas of our businesses together for our communities. We are thrilled to explore the opportunities.</p>



<h3 id="h-about-omniaverse"><strong>About OmniaVerse&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>OmniaVerse is a multi-chain platform that allows its users to monetize their artwork using metaverse-supported gaming platforms that support GLB models (Meta, Minecraft etc.).</p>

<p>When the high speed of transactions is concerned, the Avalanche project is one of the very best nominees. Avalanche is the first smart contract platform that validates transactions in less than a second. But the attractiveness of this project is not only limited to its speed, but it enjoys a high level of security because to be hacked, taking the control of over 80% of validators will be needed. The unique architecture of Avalanche helps it have high scalability compared to other blockchain networks. The speed and scalability features help develop and run decentralised applications (dApps) like games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12868" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png 1000w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-300x225.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>MetaMask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets out there, because of its outstanding features. Being a gateway to the Web 3 ecosystem of dApps, you can connect it to different blockchain networks. Features like easy integration, ease of use, and wide compatibility with different platforms are only a few reasons why many users prefer it over other wallets. According to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-20/ethereum-overhaul-risks-creating-a-new-class-of-crypto-kingpins">MetaMask is the most popular non-custodial wallet, with 30 million users.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-steps-to-add-avalanche-to-metamask">Steps to add Avalanche to MetaMask</h2>



<p>To be able to run dApps on the Avalanche network, you need to first add the Avalanche Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet. There are two methods to do it, which will be covered in this article. Before going any further, you will need to download and install MetaMask for Chrome to follow this tutorial. If you need help installing MetaMask, you can read <a href="https://crowdswap.org/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network/">this article</a> and follow steps 1 and 2. Let&#8217;s jump into the first and the easiest method.</p>



<h3 id="h-method-1-recommended">Method 1 (Recommended!)</h3>



<p>Step 1. <strong>Go to this address</strong>: <a href="https://avascan.info/">https://avascan.info/</a> . This is the official website of Avalanche Network.</p>



<p>Step 2. On the top bar of the page, <strong>click on the MetaMask icon, </strong>which is greyed out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1024x401.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12867" width="768" height="301" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1024x401.png 1024w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-300x118.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-768x301.png 768w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1536x602.png 1536w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Step 3. <strong>Enter your MetaMask password</strong> in the MetaMask notification pop-up window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12866" width="435" height="236" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6.png 870w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6-300x163.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-6-768x417.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></figure>



<p>Step 4. Scroll down to <strong>click on Approve</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12865" width="439" height="221" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5.png 877w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5-300x151.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></figure>



<div class="wp-container-3 wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-container-2 wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%"></div>
</div>



<p>Step 5. Confirm by clicking on<strong> Switch Network</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12864" width="439" height="221" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4.png 877w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4-300x151.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></figure>



<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully added Avalanche Network to MetaMask. Now, the MetaMask icon that was greyed out in Step 1, turns colour. If you open your wallet, you should see the following window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12863" width="441" height="392" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3.png 882w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3-300x267.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3-768x683.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></figure>



<p>Method 2 (Manual)</p>



<p>Step 1. On the top of your MetaMask, <strong>click on </strong>the network drop-down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12862" width="440" height="91" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-2.png 880w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-2-300x62.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-2-768x159.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></figure>



<p>Step 2. Click on <strong>Add Network.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12861" width="374" height="155" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1.png 748w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></figure>



<p>Step 3.<strong> Enter the following data </strong>in the new window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Network Name</strong></td><td>C-Chain</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network URL</strong></td><td>https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chain ID</strong></td><td>43114</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Currency Symbol</strong></td><td>AVAX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Block Explorer URL</strong></td><td>https://avascan.info/blockchain/2q9e4r6Mu3U68nU1fYjgbR6JvwrRx36CohpAX5UQxse55x1Q5/</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Step 4. Click on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12860" width="501" height="104" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png 1002w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-300x62.png 300w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-768x159.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></figure>



<p>Now, your MetaMask wallet should be connected to Avalanche Network.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we introduced two methods to add Avalanche to MetaMask. Both are essentially the same, except that in the first method, entering the data is done automatically for you, while in the second method, you need to enter the same data manually. Either way, make sure you find the data to be entered from a reliable source.</p>

TVL has been a yardstick for measuring how usable and popular the entire DeFi ecosystem or a particular project is. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions. In this article, we discuss what TVL is, why is it important and how to check this useful indicator.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin by noting that the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is based on the blockchain network, where there is no central authority. This means the contributors (or stakeholders, if you will) who run the system are in a decentralized network. To have an up-and-running decentralized financial system, the contributors put (lock) their assets in a liquidity pool. The liquidity pool can include amounts that are staked, farmed or put as loan collateral. TVL measures the total value of these locked assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how is TVL calculated? It is a pretty straightforward mathematical procedure. The amount of TVL is calculated by multiplying the assets locked as collateral in an ecosystem by the current price of the assets. Simply put, we can say:</p>



<p>Total Value Locked = invested assets * the assets&#8217; price.</p>



<p>Here, the key parameter to look for is that TVL depends on the transaction fees of the Ethereum network. The reason is that DeFi is, in essence, built on the Ethereum platform, and the transfer fees of DeFi tokens are paid with the help of the Ethereum network. However, the critical point is that there is a negative correlation between Ethereum network fees and TVL. This means that when the world&#8217;s second-biggest cryptocurrency transaction fees increase, the total value locked decreases.</p>



<p>In addition, the overall market conditions and the first coin of the cryptocurrency market, i.e., Bitcoin, also impact TVL. When you stake your tokens, based on the contract that you have signed, you cannot access your tokens for a while. So if the market conditions are bad, fewer investors will want to lock their tokens because they believe their value will decrease if their assets are locked somewhere. Nonetheless, long-term investors still see staking and yield farming as one of their <a href="https://crowdswap.org/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">viable options during a bear market</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tvl-important">Why is TVL important?</h2>



<p>As DeFi grows in interest amongst investors, new projects are introduced daily. With so many new projects coming into existence, hearing about scam projects is not surprising. One needs to check some indicators to ensure a project is trustworthy and healthy. Market capitalization and the volume of trade can be good indicators to look into before investing in a DeFi project. But TVL is another factor that has a special meaning in the world of DeFi. The higher the TVL, the more reliable and healthier project. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions.</p>



<p>In addition, some investors use TVL to see if the project they intend to invest in is overvalued or undervalued. This can be done by calculating the TVL ratio. Three factors are critical for calculating the TVL ratio:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>project&#8217;s supply</li><li>maximum circulating supply</li><li>current price</li></ul>



<p>To get the TVL ratio of a DeFi project, do the following two steps:</p>



<ol><li>Multiply the project&#8217;s supply by its current price. This gives you the total market capitalization of that project.</li><li>Divide the market cap by the maximum circulating supply.</li></ol>



<p>If the resulting figure is below 1, the project is undervalued and thus attractive to investors. But if it is above 1, it probably is overvalued and less attractive for investment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>TVL is the value of total assets that are locked in the world of DeFi. TVL can act as a benchmark for the overall conditions of the DeFi ecosystem and individual projects. In addition, TVL is a reference measure for the usage, value and credibility of a DeFi protocol.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-daily-compound-interest">What is daily compound interest?</h2>



<p>The incredible growth of crypto-currencies lately had the world believe in the importance of investing in this wholly new and profitable world. Currently, the concern of financial risks has given its place to finding and choosing the best investment method. Whereas most investors do not have specific knowledge about types of interests and how much money they can earn with less effort. Compound interest has helped many people meet their goals and go beyond their financial targets. Yet, the concept is still vogue to some people. Since comprehending and applying this strategy make the crypto world more exciting for investors, we will discuss compound interest&#8217;s aspects.</p>



<h2 id="h-compound-vs-simple-interest">Compound vs. Simple Interest</h2>



<p>After depositing money into a financial system, you expect to earn interest rewards. Interests are divided into two main types. Simple and compound. To understand both concepts clearly, starting with simple interest is a good idea.</p>



<h3 id="h-simple-interest">Simple interest</h3>



<p>By the name itself, it is short and steady interest. Simple interest refers to the earned interest on the actual money deposited. Let&#8217;s discuss it through examples. If you invest $100 as the principal amount at the rate of 5% per year, by the end of the year, you have earned $5. It means it is calculated by multiplying the principal by the given rate. In this example, 100 multiplied by 5% equivalents 5. The critical point is the original money invested stays fixed, and each year you will earn $5. Take a look at this formula to learn how to calculate simple interest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="366" height="149" src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12820" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1.png 366w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></figure>



<h3 id="h-compound-interest">Compound interest</h3>



<p>Contrary to simple interest, compound interest is not based on a fixed basis. Although it is a helpful method, the concept seems complicated to users. Learning the compound interest strategy is suitable for those who are aware of the constant pump and dump of the crypto market and are not easily fooled by the tricks of the whales. The only key to applying it is to be patient.</p>



<p>Explaining through example, consider a snowball. Suppose you are standing on top of a snow hill and a small snowball is in your hands. Now, a slight push is enough for this snowball to fall from the top of the mountain to the entire slope.</p>



<p>Along the way, the snowball gets bigger and bigger. By the time it reaches the ground, it has multiplied in size! In this example, if you rush to spend, you will get a small snowball or eventually double, but the passage of time and a lot of patience will reward the patient investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compound Interest is calculated according to the principal and profits of the previous periods. For example, you enter cryptocurrency trading with $100 and add your monthly profit to the principal amount. Through this method, the profit from your property will increase exponentially. This investment method has a faster growth rate than simple interest. Simple interest is a fixed amount assigned to your initial amount invested, but compound interest accounts for your monthly profits and the principal. With this strategy, your investment will multiply in a few years.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-calculate-compound-interest">How to calculate compound interest?</h2>



<p>One of the common mistakes of traders is entering the crypto-currency trading market without sufficient knowledge and information. The growing interest in the crypto market and the introduction of new cryptocurrencies draw people&#8217;s attention to investing. But, when starting, these people forget the importance of investment strategies. A group enters this risky field with only their life capital, and another group buys a new cryptocurrency without knowing the market. Do not forget that calculating the rate of return on investment is one of the essential things a trader or investor interested in crypto should pay attention to. Here is the daily compound interest formula:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="383" height="246" src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12821" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2.png 383w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>A = final amount</p>



<p>P = initial principal balance</p>



<p>r&nbsp; = interest rate</p>



<p>n = number of times interest applied per period</p>



<p>t&nbsp; = number of periods elapsed.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s discuss it with an example. Suppose you deposit $10000 to the annual rate of 5%. According to this chart, after ten years, you will end up with around $15000. You can calculate your interest rate using the compound interest formula. The formula is as follows:</p>



<p>P = 10000</p>



<p>r&nbsp; = 5%</p>



<p>n = 1</p>



<p>t&nbsp; = 10</p>



<p>A = 10000 (1 + 0.05 / 1) (1× 10) = 16,288.95</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Course length</strong></td><td><strong>The amount of profit based on the rate of 5%</strong></td><td><strong>Profit calculation</strong></td><td><strong>Amount of capital Ultimate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>First year</td><td>$500</td><td>$10,500</td><td><strong>$10,000 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Second year</td><td>$525</td><td>$11,025</td><td><strong>$10,500 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Third year</td><td>$551.25</td><td>$11,576.25</td><td><strong>$11,025 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Fourth year</td><td>$578.81</td><td>$12,155.06</td><td><strong>$11,576.25 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Fifth year</td><td>$607.75</td><td>$12,762.82</td><td><strong>$12,155.06 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Sixth year</td><td>$638.14</td><td>$13,400.96</td><td><strong>$12,762.82 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Seventh year</td><td>$670.05</td><td>$14,071</td><td><strong>$13,400.96 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Eighth year</td><td>$703.55</td><td>$14,774.55</td><td><strong>$14,071 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Ninth year</td><td>$738.73</td><td>$15,513.28</td><td><strong>$14,774.55 x 5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>10th year</td><td>$775.66</td><td>$16,288.95</td><td><strong>$15,513.28 x 5%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-compound-daily-interest-and-defi">Compound Daily Interest and DeFi</h2>



<p>To see how compound interest works with DeFi, consider staking crypto. As mentioned above, reinvesting the rewards rather than paying them out is the result. Every time you make a reward with tokens, put it back into the staking pool. The next time you will start earning a profit on the initial principal deposited plus reinvested interests into the smart contract. Notably, since the staking profits are daily, each day, you can make compound interest exponentially. By the end of the year, you can gain more profit than you aimed to have with a simple interest-earning strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-daily-compound-interest-in-crowdswap">Daily Compound Interest in CrowdSwap</h2>



<p>Now we all know earning compound interest comes in handy for users to apply. Since CrowdSwap concentrates on simplifying DeFi investments, we provide a built method to make a simple but desirable outcome for users. Thorugh <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">opportunities</a> service, compound profit (based on APY), and daily interest are defined specifically, ready for you to choose your investing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-you-do-the-math">You do the math!</h2>



<p>Earning profit from crypto-currency trading has different strategies, and each person desires to be a part of this market. While traders are busy with their short and long trades, those who are intelligent and patient own the most profit. Pay attention to the upward trend of the value in the last few years! Someone who has neglected his $1,000 profit has already pocketed millions in capital.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-launches-crosschain-feature-in-opportunities"><strong><strong>CrowdSwap Launches Crosschain Feature in &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;</strong></strong></h2>



<p>As of October 3, 2022, CrowdSwap has launched an update in the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> to integrate the crosschain investment feature. Let&#8217;s discuss how this feature can contribute to a safer, less complex experience of DeFi investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The crosschain solution has been around for some time now. Its main aim is to bridge different blockchains, which enables cryptocurrency users to transfer their assets across two blockchains.</p>



<p>In general, integration of the crosschain swap feature into the offered investment options can facilitate the process of staking and yield farming in many ways, some of which are explained below.</p>



<h2 id="h-higher-security"><strong><strong>Higher Security</strong></strong></h2>



<p>It is a no-brainer to any investor that the number 1 rule of investment of any kind is to make sure that your capital is safe. Therefore, you need to ensure that you don&#8217;t risk your capital in the process of investing it. Furthermore, despite the benefits of blockchain-based transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi), these come with inherent risks. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s imagine an investor would like to stake their Ethereum (ETH) on a Polygon (MATIC) liquidity pool. To do so, they need to conduct the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX0: ETH (Ethereum) -&gt; MATIC (Polygon)</p>



<p>TX1: Swap MATIC -&gt; USDC</p>



<p>TX2: Swap MATIC -&gt; MAI</p>



<p>TX3: Add Liquidity USDC/MAI to Quickswap LP &lt;- receive LP Token from this TX</p>



<p>TX4: Stake LP token</p>



<p>In some cases, the investor might need to conduct each transaction on a different platform, exposing their wallet to different kinds of threats. </p>



<p>CrowdSwap can fully eliminate this risk by offering a crosschain solution. More precisely, with this new feature, the ETH holder doesn&#8217;t need to take their ETH to MATIC to a different crosschain platform to swap it first. Rather, you can directly put your ETH to a liquidity pool, say USDC-MATIC,  and the crosschain swap is done for you automatically. With this integration of crosschain and &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;, CrowdSwap makes sure that your transactions are conducted on a highly-secure platform. Using this new feature, you can participate in investment opportunities with ease of mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png" alt="Crosschain Feature" class="wp-image-12828" width="602" height="307" srcset="https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png 602w, https://crowdswap.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-time-spent"><strong>Less Time Spent</strong></h2>



<p>Time is of the essence. Volatility in the crypto market can sometimes be so high that huge price changes can happen in a matter of seconds. No investor would want to see his calculations ruined after the job is done. In addition, the slippage issue has been a bottleneck for investors. If the user is to conduct all the transactions in the above example, they are exposed to time constraints. Plus, the less time you spend on transactions, the more secure your transactions will be. </p>



<p>But what if you could reduce the effect of time? This is why you can count on CrowdSwap&#8217;s new feature to conduct your transactions in the shortest time possible.  </p>



<h2 id="h-less-complexity"><strong>Less Complexity</strong></h2>



<p>Because transactions on the blockchain network are done peer-to-peer, the investor bears the sole responsibility for checking the transaction information meticulously. Once a transaction is confirmed by the validators, there is no way to revert it, because there is no central authority who has the power to override that transaction. Hence, conducting multiple transactions, often on different platforms, and signing several smart contracts increases the risks of losing your assets in the process. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go back to our earlier example. In case a mistake happens in one of the TX0, TX1, TX2, TX3 or TX4 steps, your assets may be at risk. So, a wise investor would look for ways to decrease the number of transactions to mitigate the risk. In a nutshell, the more transactions, the higher the risk of losing your assets in the middle.</p>



<p>CrowdSwap&#8217;s crosschain feature helps reduce this complexity by doing everything for you in a single transaction. Therefore, the user doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the number of transactions on several platforms, because it is done for them automatically. This way, the user can directly stake their existing tokens on any blockchain and the rest is done for them by CrowdSwap.</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-the-ultimate-solution"><strong>CrowdSwap; the Ultimate Solution</strong></h2>



<p>Now, after the successful launch of the crosschain and CCLP features by CrowdSwap in Q1, and staking and yield farming opportunities in Q3 of 2022, it is time to integrate these two features. </p>



<p>After the launch of this outstanding feature, staking and yield farming opportunities can be done in no time with high speed and exceptional security while making sure that you pay reasonable fees for it. So, head to the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> of the CrowdSwap App and make your first investment using this new feature.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-partners-with-resonate-to-innovate-and-simplify-defi-products">CrowdSwap partners with Resonate to Innovate, and simplify DeFi products</h2>



<p>CrowdSwap is proud to announce our new partnership with <a href="https://www.resonate.finance/">Resonate</a>. Resonate is a DeFi Yield Futures protocol that makes future yield available right at the start of the investment. The innovative FNFT (financial NFT) solution gives the user access to immediate rewards and liquidity throughout the locking term.&nbsp; Through the support of Resonate, CrowdSwap will open up innovative staking crypto opportunities and liquidity mining offers to its loyal users that are second to none.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-challenge">The challenge</h2>



<p>In uncertain times, many participants in the financial markets tend to shy away from risk. Of course, this is also true for the DeFi market. The more optimistic, the more likely an individual is to use yield farms or DeFi staking offers, where the capital deposited is locked in for a certain period of time. As a result, these offers are taken up less and thus the liquidity needed for the projects is not available.</p>



<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be perfect if users could directly access all the staking rewards upfront and the protocols still withheld their liquidity?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-solution">The solution</h2>



<p>This is exactly where Resonate comes in. The DeFi Yield Futures protocol assures users of the agreed staking rewards directly, so they don&#8217;t have to wait until the end of the investment period. Uncertainty about future rewards development is no longer a limiting factor.</p>



<p>There are two key advantages when considering the implementation of Resonate. The first of which is the payout time of the rewards, which are paid out right at the beginning rather than over time &#8211; these staking rewards can then be used to either cover one&#8217;s long position or take advantage of further opportunities in DeFi. Secondly, the FNFT will always remain liquid, as it can be sold on most NFT marketplaces despite the underlying tokens remaining locked throughout. This unique concept also helps CrowdSwap to set up the project in a more stable way in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-and-resonate-partnership">CrowdSwap and Resonate Partnership</h2>



<p>In addition, CrowdSwap and Resonate will work together on innovative and optimized DeFi products that can ultimately benefit everyone through their simplicity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are already good examples of how higher returns can be achieved by cleverly composing DeFi opportunities. Delta hedging strategies, to name just one. CrowdSwap concentrates on simplifying such processes for all users and making them transparent without ignoring the risk factor. With Resonate we have the optimal partner for innovative DeFi products, which can be well integrated into CrowdSwap&#8217;s opportunities. CrowdSwap and Resonate will collaborate on:</p>



<ul><li>Creating Innovative DeFi Products&nbsp;<ul><li>Yield Futures, Stablecoin boosting, Synthetic Swaps</li></ul></li><li>Optimizing Yield<ul><li>Composing DeFi recipes for better yield</li></ul></li><li>Simplifying the DeFi processes&nbsp;</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Quote:</em></p><cite><em>Resonate is enthralled to have a long-term partner on its side to develop the next generation of DeFi applications. We strongly believe by integrating with CrowdSwap, we are a step closer to creating a harmonious, highly effective and frictionless DeFi ecosystem, for users and protocols alike. We look forward to working together, now and in the future to make this vision a reality.</em><br><br><em>Rob Montgomery &#8211; CEO, Resonate</em><br></cite></blockquote>



<h2 id="h-about-resonate-finance">About Resonate Finance</h2>



<p>Resonate is a Yield Futures Protocol developed by Revest Finance and built on top of Revest’s Financial NFT (FNFT) technology. Using Resonate, we’re able to separate the principal and interest components of a position by issuing two FNFTs; one containing the principal and the other containing the rights to future interest on that principal. Resonate facilitates the commerce of the rights to future interest by matching issuers (who want to sell their interest rights for a one-time upfront payment), and purchasers (who want to buy the rights to future interest for a one-time upfront payment).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-about-revest-finance">About Revest Finance</h2>



<p>The Revest Protocol offers a revolutionary new use of NFTs as financial tools through the Financial Non-Fungible Token (FNFT). Individual and enterprise-level users can deposit any ERC-20 or ERC-721 into Revest’s interactive FNFTs and set custom unlocking conditions (time, value, or contract-based). Revest allows the tokenization of all non-fungible financial positions with non-fungible tokens. This simple turn-key solution offers elegant applications ranging from token vesting to cutting-edge implications for derivative and borrowing/lending platforms. Revest’s flagship product, Resonate, is underpinned, fundamentally, by this innovative technology.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with Defi, you&#8217;ve almost heard about impermanent loss . Liquidity protocols allow any person with funds to become a market maker and earn trading costs. The democratization of&nbsp;the market economy has enabled many economic activities without friction in the cryptographic space. The advent of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created opportunities for cryptocurrency investors to earn interest on their holdings. </p>

<p>With the decentralization of traditional financial services, anyone can now provide funding to Defi applications. The deposit of digital assets, often in standard liquidity pools, can generate interest rates significantly higher than what is currently available from global banks. Decentralized exchanges use an automated market maker, which allows anyone holding tokens to deposit their tokens into a liquidity pool. </p>



<p>Where a fund has sufficient liquidity, investors may deposit an equal amount of each asset in their digital wallet. In this case, the investor is likely to receive liquidity provider tokens. This is a summary of your deposits in the form of a given percentage of the liquidity pool. In general, it is dynamic and corresponds to the liquidity flexibility the investor offers about the total amount present in the pool. For all investors, it is essential to know the risks associated with decentralized finance, better known as Defi. One of the significant risks associated with managing decentralized finance is impermanent loss. So what you need to know if you would like to provide liquidity for those platforms?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-calculate-impermanent-loss">How to calculate impermanent loss</h2>



<p>Impermanent loss occurs when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes from what you have deposited them. The greater the change, the greater the exposure to impermanent loss. In this case, the loss is lower than the dollar value at the time of withdrawal compared to the time of filing. It happens when they are deposited in an automated market maker (AMM), and removing them later causes a loss, compared to whether you left it in your wallet or not. You can&#8217;t lose money, but your earnings are less than if you had just left your assets intact. The volatility factor may be an investment risk if the digital currency is deposited into an AMM or Defi pool. </p>



<p>In a liquidity pool, the make-up of tokens is regulated by an algorithmic formula that balances the ratio of tokens in the pool. As AMM formulas prioritize balancing the ratios of the tokens in the pool, your asset value could differ from its value outside the pool, leaving you at a loss. When there is significant divergence, the severity of impermanent loss also increases, affecting the crypto portfolio of a liquidity provider. The number of liquidity providers and tokens in the liquidity pool defines the risk level of impermanent loss.</p>



<p>This is not an actual loss because the loss is based on the value of your investment if the tokens were held outside of the liquidity pool. Therefore, if you measure your cash investment, the temporary loss may not result in losing money. Liquidity pools often have two assets, and if one can be a stable currency like DAI, the other can be a more volatile cryptocurrency like ETH. The loss is only permanent if a provider withdraws their liquidity for good.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-be-a-liquidity-provider">Why be a liquidity provider?</h2>



<p>Investors are always prepared to deposit their cryptocurrencies into a DeFi pool despite the odds of impermanent loss. Liquidity providers can compensate for the loss through the collection of transaction fees. Trading costs fluctuate between different crypto trading exchanges, making crypto liquidity pools profitable even though they have the risk of impermanent loss. Trading charges refer to a specific amount a person must pay when purchasing or selling cryptocurrency. While making such a transaction, a wide range of percentages or rates is added to the basic fees. If your yield generates higher returns than the amount you lose from impermanent loss, you can get more profit than just holding the tokens.</p>



<p>Furthermore, by receiving a yield on your tokens in a liquidity pool, you also transform them into productive assets. In many cases, earned expenses could easily undo losses. Thus, investment in a liquidity pool could always be profitable even if the value of the cryptocurrency changes.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-can-we-avoid-impermanent-loss">How can we avoid impermanent loss?</h2>



<p>Price switching called impermanent loss because prices may revert to the original exchange price in the future. The impermanent loss reverse if your asset  assessed at the same price as the original deposit. The loss only becomes permanent if you withdraw your money from the liquidity pool. How do you prevent impermanent losses? Liquidity providers are unable to avoid impermanent loss altogether. But there are things they can do to mitigate that risk. Some liquidity pools are at a much higher risk of impermanent loss than others. Generally, the more volatile the fund&#8217;s assets, the more likely you will experience impermanent loss. Alternatively, it may be best to start with a small deposit. </p>



<p>This way, you can get an approximate estimate of your expected returns before committing more money. However, they may use specific measures to reduce this risk, such as using stablecoin pairs and avoiding volatile pairs. It is crucial to ensure that these cryptocurrency pairs track roughly the same price. It is essential for ensuring and recording price movements among the given cryptocurrency pair. In addition, you can prevent the temporary loss  in a more significant measure if the price volatility of a particular cryptocurrency does not exist at the outset.</p>



<p> Consequently, keeping cryptocurrency peers low volatility is a potential key for little or no impermanent loss. The extent of impermanent loss may also be estimated. Taking into account the unpredictable nature of the impermanent loss and its intensity can also be estimated. Support investors in dealing with the complexity of impermanent losses. Several online calculators can help an investor identify the potential risks associated with depositing assets in a specific liquidity pool.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Despite the risk, liquidity providers remain prepared to put down their assets to the extent that it is possible to compensate for such a loss (in whole or part) by charging a fee. The fee is generally paid through decentralized exchanges. The loss becomes permanent only if a provider withdraws its liquid assets permanently. However, they can use measures to mitigate this risk, such as using stablecoin pairs and avoiding volatility.</p>
