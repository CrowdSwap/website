<h2 id="h-crowdswap-partners-with-omniaverse-to-take-metaverse-gaming-to-the-next-level"><strong>CrowdSwap partners with OmniaVerse to take metaverse gaming to the next level</strong></h2>



<p>CrowdSwap is proud to announce its partnership with <a href="https://omniaverse.io/">OmniaVerse</a>, a multi-chain platform that allows its users to monetize their artwork using metaverse-supported gaming platforms. Through the support of CrowdSwap, OmniaVerse will be able to add best-price routing and swaps seamlessly to their platform.</p>



<h3 id="h-status-quo"><strong>Status quo</strong></h3>



<p>After the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies, play-to-earn (P2E) games have become commonplace among gamers. Even non-gamers have shown interest in blockchain-based games because of their unique P2E experience. Besides the concentration on NFTs, OmniaVerse wants to integrate a swap functionality for cryptocurrency swaps into their project tokens and future tokens that will launch on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-solution-and-partnership"><strong>The solution and partnership</strong></h3>



<p>CrowdSwap&#8217;s best-price routing and swap feature is one of the most popular features used and appreciated by our community daily. We are excited that Omniaverse will be the first project to natively incorporate this function into their platform via the CrowdSwap API. The API will give Omniaverse&#8217;s community direct access to the supported blockchains Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche. As part of the collaboration, we will continuously expand the functionality of the API. The need for atomic cross-chain swaps already exists and will be essential in a proper multi-chain environment. Cross-chain swaps will be integrated into the API next, allowing Omniaverse to add a seamless multi-chain feeling to its offering automatically.</p>



<p>Best-price routing is based on a meshed graph over the liquidity pools of the respective blockchains. These graphs determine the best routes to the requested coins and tokens. The various prices of the DEXes are then further matched with the swap ancillary costs before a processed ranking is returned to the callers. Price and cost are based on on-chain data that is constantly updated to achieve the best possible result.</p>



<p>Through the CrowdSwap API, projects can natively and easily integrate the benefits of a best-price swap solution into their application, delivering a one-stop user experience to their community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OmniaVerse and CrowdSwap agreed to start a strategic collaboration bringing synergies from different areas of our businesses together for our communities. We are thrilled to explore the opportunities.</p>



<h3 id="h-about-omniaverse"><strong>About OmniaVerse&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>OmniaVerse is a multi-chain platform that allows its users to monetize their artwork using metaverse-supported gaming platforms that support GLB models (Meta, Minecraft etc.).</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-add-avalanche-to-metamask">How to add Avalanche to MetaMask</h2>



<p>When the high speed of transactions is concerned, the Avalanche project is one of the very best nominees. Avalanche is the first smart contract platform that validates transactions in less than a second. But the attractiveness of this project is not only limited to its speed, but it enjoys a high level of security because to be hacked, taking the control of over 80% of validators will be needed. The unique architecture of Avalanche helps it have high scalability compared to other blockchain networks. The speed and scalability features help develop and run decentralised applications (dApps) like games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12868" width="500" height="375" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8.png 1000w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-300x225.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-8-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>MetaMask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets out there, because of its outstanding features. Being a gateway to the Web 3 ecosystem of dApps, you can connect it to different blockchain networks. Features like easy integration, ease of use, and wide compatibility with different platforms are only a few reasons why many users prefer it over other wallets. According to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-20/ethereum-overhaul-risks-creating-a-new-class-of-crypto-kingpins">MetaMask is the most popular non-custodial wallet, with 30 million users.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-steps-to-add-avalanche-to-metamask">Steps to add Avalanche to MetaMask</h2>



<p>To be able to run dApps on the Avalanche network, you need to first add the Avalanche Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet. There are two methods to do it, which will be covered in this article. Before going any further, you will need to download and install MetaMask for Chrome to follow this tutorial. If you need help installing MetaMask, you can read <a href="//web/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network/">this article</a> and follow steps 1 and 2. Let&#8217;s jump into the first and the easiest method.</p>



<h3 id="h-method-1-recommended">Method 1 (Recommended!)</h3>



<p>Step 1. <strong>Go to this address</strong>: <a href="https://avascan.info/">https://avascan.info/</a> . This is the official website of Avalanche Network.</p>



<p>Step 2. On the top bar of the page, <strong>click on the MetaMask icon, </strong>which is greyed out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1024x401.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12867" width="768" height="301" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1024x401.png 1024w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-300x118.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-768x301.png 768w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7-1536x602.png 1536w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-7.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Step 3. <strong>Enter your MetaMask password</strong> in the MetaMask notification pop-up window.</p>

<p>Step 4. Scroll down to <strong>click on Approve</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12865" width="439" height="221" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5.png 877w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5-300x151.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></figure>



<div class="wp-container-3 wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-container-2 wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%"></div>
</div>



<p>Step 5. Confirm by clicking on<strong> Switch Network</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12864" width="439" height="221" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4.png 877w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4-300x151.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-4-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></figure>



<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully added Avalanche Network to MetaMask. Now, the MetaMask icon that was greyed out in Step 1, turns colour. If you open your wallet, you should see the following window.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12863" width="441" height="392" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3.png 882w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3-300x267.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-3-768x683.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></figure>



<p>Method 2 (Manual)</p>

<p>Step 4. Click on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12860" width="501" height="104" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png 1002w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-300x62.png 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-768x159.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></figure>



<p>Now, your MetaMask wallet should be connected to Avalanche Network.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we introduced two methods to add Avalanche to MetaMask. Both are essentially the same, except that in the first method, entering the data is done automatically for you, while in the second method, you need to enter the same data manually. Either way, make sure you find the data to be entered from a reliable source.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-tvl-in-defi-why-is-it-important">What is TVL in DeFi? Why is it important?</h2>



<p>Total Value Locked (TVL) is the value of assets locked in a <a href="//web/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a> protocol in the form of staking, yield farming and loan collaterals. TVL has been a yardstick for measuring how usable and popular the entire DeFi ecosystem or a particular project is. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions. In this article, we discuss what TVL is, why is it important and how to check this useful indicator.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-tvl">What is TVL?</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s begin by noting that the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is based on the blockchain network, where there is no central authority. This means the contributors (or stakeholders, if you will) who run the system are in a decentralized network. To have an up-and-running decentralized financial system, the contributors put (lock) their assets in a liquidity pool. The liquidity pool can include amounts that are staked, farmed or put as loan collateral. TVL measures the total value of these locked assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how is TVL calculated? It is a pretty straightforward mathematical procedure. The amount of TVL is calculated by multiplying the assets locked as collateral in an ecosystem by the current price of the assets. Simply put, we can say:</p>



<p>Total Value Locked = invested assets * the assets&#8217; price.</p>



<p>Here, the key parameter to look for is that TVL depends on the transaction fees of the Ethereum network. The reason is that DeFi is, in essence, built on the Ethereum platform, and the transfer fees of DeFi tokens are paid with the help of the Ethereum network. However, the critical point is that there is a negative correlation between Ethereum network fees and TVL. This means that when the world&#8217;s second-biggest cryptocurrency transaction fees increase, the total value locked decreases.</p>



<p>In addition, the overall market conditions and the first coin of the cryptocurrency market, i.e., Bitcoin, also impact TVL. When you stake your tokens, based on the contract that you have signed, you cannot access your tokens for a while. So if the market conditions are bad, fewer investors will want to lock their tokens because they believe their value will decrease if their assets are locked somewhere. Nonetheless, long-term investors still see staking and yield farming as one of their <a href="//web/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">viable options during a bear market</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tvl-important">Why is TVL important?</h2>



<p>As DeFi grows in interest amongst investors, new projects are introduced daily. With so many new projects coming into existence, hearing about scam projects is not surprising. One needs to check some indicators to ensure a project is trustworthy and healthy. Market capitalization and the volume of trade can be good indicators to look into before investing in a DeFi project. But TVL is another factor that has a special meaning in the world of DeFi. The higher the TVL, the more reliable and healthier project. In addition, it can be used as a signal for the overall DeFi market conditions.</p>



<p>In addition, some investors use TVL to see if the project they intend to invest in is overvalued or undervalued. This can be done by calculating the TVL ratio. Three factors are critical for calculating the TVL ratio:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>project&#8217;s supply</li><li>maximum circulating supply</li><li>current price</li></ul>



<p>To get the TVL ratio of a DeFi project, do the following two steps:</p>



<ol><li>Multiply the project&#8217;s supply by its current price. This gives you the total market capitalization of that project.</li><li>Divide the market cap by the maximum circulating supply.</li></ol>



<p>If the resulting figure is below 1, the project is undervalued and thus attractive to investors. But if it is above 1, it probably is overvalued and less attractive for investment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>TVL is the value of total assets that are locked in the world of DeFi. TVL can act as a benchmark for the overall conditions of the DeFi ecosystem and individual projects. In addition, TVL is a reference measure for the usage, value and credibility of a DeFi protocol.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-daily-compound-interest">What is daily compound interest?</h2>



<p>The incredible growth of crypto-currencies lately had the world believe in the importance of investing in this wholly new and profitable world. Currently, the concern of financial risks has given its place to finding and choosing the best investment method. Whereas most investors do not have specific knowledge about types of interests and how much money they can earn with less effort. Compound interest has helped many people meet their goals and go beyond their financial targets. Yet, the concept is still vogue to some people. Since comprehending and applying this strategy make the crypto world more exciting for investors, we will discuss compound interest&#8217;s aspects.</p>



<h2 id="h-compound-vs-simple-interest">Compound vs. Simple Interest</h2>



<p>After depositing money into a financial system, you expect to earn interest rewards. Interests are divided into two main types. Simple and compound. To understand both concepts clearly, starting with simple interest is a good idea.</p>



<h3 id="h-simple-interest">Simple interest</h3>



<p>By the name itself, it is short and steady interest. Simple interest refers to the earned interest on the actual money deposited. Let&#8217;s discuss it through examples. If you invest $100 as the principal amount at the rate of 5% per year, by the end of the year, you have earned $5. It means it is calculated by multiplying the principal by the given rate. In this example, 100 multiplied by 5% equivalents 5. The critical point is the original money invested stays fixed, and each year you will earn $5. Take a look at this formula to learn how to calculate simple interest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="366" height="149" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12820" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1.png 366w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-1-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></figure>



<h3 id="h-compound-interest">Compound interest</h3>



<p>Contrary to simple interest, compound interest is not based on a fixed basis. Although it is a helpful method, the concept seems complicated to users. Learning the compound interest strategy is suitable for those who are aware of the constant pump and dump of the crypto market and are not easily fooled by the tricks of the whales. The only key to applying it is to be patient.</p>



<p>Explaining through example, consider a snowball. Suppose you are standing on top of a snow hill and a small snowball is in your hands. Now, a slight push is enough for this snowball to fall from the top of the mountain to the entire slope.</p>



<p>Along the way, the snowball gets bigger and bigger. By the time it reaches the ground, it has multiplied in size! In this example, if you rush to spend, you will get a small snowball or eventually double, but the passage of time and a lot of patience will reward the patient investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compound Interest is calculated according to the principal and profits of the previous periods. For example, you enter cryptocurrency trading with $100 and add your monthly profit to the principal amount. Through this method, the profit from your property will increase exponentially. This investment method has a faster growth rate than simple interest. Simple interest is a fixed amount assigned to your initial amount invested, but compound interest accounts for your monthly profits and the principal. With this strategy, your investment will multiply in a few years.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-calculate-compound-interest">How to calculate compound interest?</h2>



<p>One of the common mistakes of traders is entering the crypto-currency trading market without sufficient knowledge and information. The growing interest in the crypto market and the introduction of new cryptocurrencies draw people&#8217;s attention to investing. But, when starting, these people forget the importance of investment strategies. A group enters this risky field with only their life capital, and another group buys a new cryptocurrency without knowing the market. Do not forget that calculating the rate of return on investment is one of the essential things a trader or investor interested in crypto should pay attention to. Here is the daily compound interest formula:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="383" height="246" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12821" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2.png 383w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/compound-interest-2-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>A = final amount</p>



<p>P = initial principal balance</p>



<p>r&nbsp; = interest rate</p>



<p>n = number of times interest applied per period</p>



<p>t&nbsp; = number of periods elapsed.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s discuss it with an example. Suppose you deposit $10000 to the annual rate of 5%. According to this chart, after ten years, you will end up with around $15000. You can calculate your interest rate using the compound interest formula. The formula is as follows:</p>



<p>P = 10000</p>



<p>r&nbsp; = 5%</p>



<p>n = 1</p>



<p>t&nbsp; = 10</p>



<p>A = 10000 (1 + 0.05 / 1) (1Ã 10) = 16,288.95</p>

<p>To see how compound interest works with DeFi, consider staking crypto. As mentioned above, reinvesting the rewards rather than paying them out is the result. Every time you make a reward with tokens, put it back into the staking pool. The next time you will start earning a profit on the initial principal deposited plus reinvested interests into the smart contract. Notably, since the staking profits are daily, each day, you can make compound interest exponentially. By the end of the year, you can gain more profit than you aimed to have with a simple interest-earning strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-daily-compound-interest-in-crowdswap">Daily Compound Interest in CrowdSwap</h2>



<p>Now we all know earning compound interest comes in handy for users to apply. Since CrowdSwap concentrates on simplifying DeFi investments, we provide a built method to make a simple but desirable outcome for users. Thorugh <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">opportunities</a> service, compound profit (based on APY), and daily interest are defined specifically, ready for you to choose your investing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-you-do-the-math">You do the math!</h2>



<p>Earning profit from crypto-currency trading has different strategies, and each person desires to be a part of this market. While traders are busy with their short and long trades, those who are intelligent and patient own the most profit. Pay attention to the upward trend of the value in the last few years! Someone who has neglected his $1,000 profit has already pocketed millions in capital.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-launches-crosschain-feature-in-opportunities"><strong><strong>CrowdSwap Launches Crosschain Feature in &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;</strong></strong></h2>



<p>As of October 3, 2022, CrowdSwap has launched an update in the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> to integrate the crosschain investment feature. Let&#8217;s discuss how this feature can contribute to a safer, less complex experience of DeFi investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The crosschain solution has been around for some time now. Its main aim is to bridge different blockchains, which enables cryptocurrency users to transfer their assets across two blockchains.</p>



<p>In general, integration of the crosschain swap feature into the offered investment options can facilitate the process of staking and yield farming in many ways, some of which are explained below.</p>



<h2 id="h-higher-security"><strong><strong>Higher Security</strong></strong></h2>



<p>It is a no-brainer to any investor that the number 1 rule of investment of any kind is to make sure that your capital is safe. Therefore, you need to ensure that you don&#8217;t risk your capital in the process of investing it. Furthermore, despite the benefits of blockchain-based transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi), these come with inherent risks.Â </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s imagine an investor would like to stake their Ethereum (ETH) on a Polygon (MATIC) liquidity pool. To do so, they need to conduct the following transactions:</p>



<p>TX0: ETH (Ethereum) -&gt; MATIC (Polygon)</p>



<p>TX1: Swap MATIC -&gt; USDC</p>



<p>TX2: Swap MATIC -&gt; MAI</p>



<p>TX3: Add Liquidity USDC/MAI to Quickswap LP &lt;- receive LP Token from this TX</p>



<p>TX4: Stake LP token</p>



<p>In some cases, the investor might need to conduct each transaction on a different platform, exposing their wallet to different kinds of threats.Â </p>



<p>CrowdSwap can fully eliminate this risk by offering a crosschain solution. More precisely, with this new feature, the ETH holder doesn&#8217;t need to take their ETH to MATIC to a different crosschain platform to swap it first. Rather, you can directly put your ETH to a liquidity pool, say USDC-MATIC,Â  and the crosschain swap is done for you automatically. With this integration of crosschain and &#8216;Opportunities&#8217;, CrowdSwap makes sure that your transactions are conducted on a highly-secure platform. Using this new feature, you can participate in investment opportunities with ease of mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png" alt="Crosschain Feature" class="wp-image-12828" width="602" height="307" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12.png 602w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Picture12-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-time-spent"><strong>Less Time Spent</strong></h2>



<p>Time is of the essence. Volatility in the crypto market can sometimes be so high that huge price changes can happen in a matter of seconds. No investor would want to see his calculations ruined after the job is done. In addition, the slippage issue has been a bottleneck for investors. If the user is to conduct all the transactions in the above example, they are exposed to time constraints. Plus, the less time you spend on transactions, the more secure your transactions will be.Â </p>



<p>But what if you could reduce the effect of time? This is why you can count on CrowdSwap&#8217;s new feature to conduct your transactions in the shortest time possible.Â Â </p>



<h2 id="h-less-complexity"><strong>Less Complexity</strong></h2>



<p>Because transactions on the blockchain network are done peer-to-peer, the investor bears the sole responsibility for checking the transaction information meticulously. Once a transaction is confirmed by the validators, there is no way to revert it, because there is no central authority who has the power to override that transaction. Hence, conducting multiple transactions, often on different platforms, and signing several smart contracts increases the risks of losing your assets in the process.Â </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go back to our earlier example. In case a mistake happens in one of the TX0, TX1, TX2, TX3 or TX4 steps, your assets may be at risk. So, a wise investor would look for ways to decrease the number of transactions to mitigate the risk. In a nutshell, the more transactions, the higher the risk of losing your assets in the middle.</p>



<p>CrowdSwap&#8217;s crosschain feature helps reduce this complexity by doing everything for you in a single transaction. Therefore, the user doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the number of transactions on several platforms, because it is done for them automatically. This way, the user can directly stake their existing tokens on any blockchain and the rest is done for them by CrowdSwap.</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-the-ultimate-solution"><strong>CrowdSwap; the Ultimate Solution</strong></h2>



<p>Now, after the successful launch of the crosschain and CCLP features by CrowdSwap in Q1, and staking and yield farming opportunities in Q3 of 2022, it is time to integrate these two features.Â </p>



<p>After the launch of this outstanding feature, staking and yield farming opportunities can be done in no time with high speed and exceptional security while making sure that you pay reasonable fees for it. So, head to the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">&#8216;OPPORTUNITIES&#8217; section</a> of the CrowdSwap App and make your first investment using this new feature.</p>

<h2 id="h-crowdswap-partners-with-resonate-to-innovate-and-simplify-defi-products">CrowdSwap partners with Resonate to Innovate, and simplify DeFi products</h2>



<p>CrowdSwap is proud to announce our new partnership with <a href="https://www.resonate.finance/">Resonate</a>. Resonate is a DeFi Yield Futures protocol that makes future yield available right at the start of the investment. The innovative FNFT (financial NFT) solution gives the user access to immediate rewards and liquidity throughout the locking term.&nbsp; Through the support of Resonate, CrowdSwap will open up innovative staking crypto opportunities and liquidity mining offers to its loyal users that are second to none.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-challenge">The challenge</h2>



<p>In uncertain times, many participants in the financial markets tend to shy away from risk. Of course, this is also true for the DeFi market. The more optimistic, the more likely an individual is to use yield farms or DeFi staking offers, where the capital deposited is locked in for a certain period of time. As a result, these offers are taken up less and thus the liquidity needed for the projects is not available.</p>



<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be perfect if users could directly access all the staking rewards upfront and the protocols still withheld their liquidity?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-solution">The solution</h2>



<p>This is exactly where Resonate comes in. The DeFi Yield Futures protocol assures users of the agreed staking rewards directly, so they don&#8217;t have to wait until the end of the investment period. Uncertainty about future rewards development is no longer a limiting factor.</p>



<p>There are two key advantages when considering the implementation of Resonate. The first of which is the payout time of the rewards, which are paid out right at the beginning rather than over time &#8211; these staking rewards can then be used to either cover one&#8217;s long position or take advantage of further opportunities in DeFi. Secondly, the FNFT will always remain liquid, as it can be sold on most NFT marketplaces despite the underlying tokens remaining locked throughout. This unique concept also helps CrowdSwap to set up the project in a more stable way in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-crowdswap-and-resonate-partnership">CrowdSwap and Resonate Partnership</h2>



<p>In addition, CrowdSwap and Resonate will work together on innovative and optimized DeFi products that can ultimately benefit everyone through their simplicity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are already good examples of how higher returns can be achieved by cleverly composing DeFi opportunities. Delta hedging strategies, to name just one. CrowdSwap concentrates on simplifying such processes for all users and making them transparent without ignoring the risk factor. With Resonate we have the optimal partner for innovative DeFi products, which can be well integrated into CrowdSwap&#8217;s opportunities. CrowdSwap and Resonate will collaborate on:</p>



<ul><li>Creating Innovative DeFi Products&nbsp;<ul><li>Yield Futures, Stablecoin boosting, Synthetic Swaps</li></ul></li><li>Optimizing Yield<ul><li>Composing DeFi recipes for better yield</li></ul></li><li>Simplifying the DeFi processes&nbsp;</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Quote:</em></p><cite><em>Resonate is enthralled to have a long-term partner on its side to develop the next generation of DeFi applications. We strongly believe by integrating with CrowdSwap, we are a step closer to creating a harmonious, highly effective and frictionless DeFi ecosystem, for users and protocols alike. We look forward to working together, now and in the future to make this vision a reality.</em><br><br><em>Rob Montgomery &#8211; CEO, Resonate</em><br></cite></blockquote>



<h2 id="h-about-resonate-finance">About Resonate Finance</h2>



<p>Resonate is a Yield Futures Protocol developed by Revest Finance and built on top of Revestâs Financial NFT (FNFT) technology. Using Resonate, weâre able to separate the principal and interest components of a position by issuing two FNFTs; one containing the principal and the other containing the rights to future interest on that principal. Resonate facilitates the commerce of the rights to future interest by matching issuers (who want to sell their interest rights for a one-time upfront payment), and purchasers (who want to buy the rights to future interest for a one-time upfront payment).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-about-revest-finance">About Revest Finance</h2>



<p>The Revest Protocol offers a revolutionary new use of NFTs as financial tools through the Financial Non-Fungible Token (FNFT). Individual and enterprise-level users can deposit any ERC-20 or ERC-721 into Revestâs interactive FNFTs and set custom unlocking conditions (time, value, or contract-based). Revest allows the tokenization of all non-fungible financial positions with non-fungible tokens. This simple turn-key solution offers elegant applications ranging from token vesting to cutting-edge implications for derivative and borrowing/lending platforms. Revestâs flagship product, Resonate, is underpinned, fundamentally, by this innovative technology.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-impermanent-loss">What is impermanent loss?</h2>



<p>If you are familiar with Defi, you&#8217;ve almost heard about impermanent loss . Liquidity protocols allow any person with funds to become a market maker and earn trading costs. The democratization of&nbsp;the market economy has enabled many economic activities without friction in the cryptographic space. The advent of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created opportunities for cryptocurrency investors to earn interest on their holdings. </p>



<p>Read more: <a href="//web/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to invest in bear market?</a></p>



<p>With the decentralization of traditional financial services, anyone can now provide funding to Defi applications. The deposit of digital assets, often in standard liquidity pools, can generate interest rates significantly higher than what is currently available from global banks. Decentralized exchanges use an automated market maker, which allows anyone holding tokens to deposit their tokens into a liquidity pool. </p>



<p>Where a fund has sufficient liquidity, investors may deposit an equal amount of each asset in their digital wallet. In this case, the investor is likely to receive liquidity provider tokens. This is a summary of your deposits in the form of a given percentage of the liquidity pool. In general, it is dynamic and corresponds to the liquidity flexibility the investor offers about the total amount present in the pool. For all investors, it is essential to know the risks associated with decentralized finance, better known as Defi. One of the significant risks associated with managing decentralized finance is impermanent loss. So what you need to know if you would like to provide liquidity for those platforms?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-calculate-impermanent-loss">How to calculate impermanent loss</h2>



<p>Impermanent loss occurs when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes from what you have deposited them. The greater the change, the greater the exposure to impermanent loss. In this case, the loss is lower than the dollar value at the time of withdrawal compared to the time of filing. It happens when they are deposited in an automated market maker (AMM), and removing them later causes a loss, compared to whether you left it in your wallet or not. You can&#8217;t lose money, but your earnings are less than if you had just left your assets intact. The volatility factor may be an investment risk if the digital currency is deposited into an AMM or Defi pool. </p>



<p>In a liquidity pool, the make-up of tokens is regulated by an algorithmic formula that balances the ratio of tokens in the pool. As AMM formulas prioritize balancing the ratios of the tokens in the pool, your asset value could differ from its value outside the pool, leaving you at a loss. When there is significant divergence, the severity of impermanent loss also increases, affecting the crypto portfolio of a liquidity provider. The number of liquidity providers and tokens in the liquidity pool defines the risk level of impermanent loss.</p>



<p>This is not an actual loss because the loss is based on the value of your investment if the tokens were held outside of the liquidity pool. Therefore, if you measure your cash investment, the temporary loss may not result in losing money. Liquidity pools often have two assets, and if one can be a stable currency like DAI, the other can be a more volatile cryptocurrency like ETH. The loss is only permanent if a provider withdraws their liquidity for good.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-be-a-liquidity-provider">Why be a liquidity provider?</h2>



<p>Investors are always prepared to deposit their cryptocurrencies into a DeFi pool despite the odds of impermanent loss. Liquidity providers can compensate for the loss through the collection of transaction fees. Trading costs fluctuate between different crypto trading exchanges, making crypto liquidity pools profitable even though they have the risk of impermanent loss. Trading charges refer to a specific amount a person must pay when purchasing or selling cryptocurrency. While making such a transaction, a wide range of percentages or rates is added to the basic fees. If your yield generates higher returns than the amount you lose from impermanent loss, you can get more profit than just holding the tokens.</p>



<p>Furthermore, by receiving a yield on your tokens in a liquidity pool, you also transform them into productive assets. In many cases, earned expenses could easily undo losses. Thus, investment in a liquidity pool could always be profitable even if the value of the cryptocurrency changes.</p>



<p>Read more: <a href="//web/liquidity-mining-defis-investment-opportunity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquidity mining; DeFiâs fascinating investment opportunity</a></p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-we-avoid-impermanent-loss">How can we avoid impermanent loss?</h2>



<p>Price switching called impermanent loss because prices may revert to the original exchange price in the future. The impermanent loss reverse if your asset  assessed at the same price as the original deposit. The loss only becomes permanent if you withdraw your money from the liquidity pool. How do you prevent impermanent losses? Liquidity providers are unable to avoid impermanent loss altogether. But there are things they can do to mitigate that risk. Some liquidity pools are at a much higher risk of impermanent loss than others. Generally, the more volatile the fund&#8217;s assets, the more likely you will experience impermanent loss. Alternatively, it may be best to start with a small deposit. </p>



<p>This way, you can get an approximate estimate of your expected returns before committing more money. However, they may use specific measures to reduce this risk, such as using stablecoin pairs and avoiding volatile pairs. It is crucial to ensure that these cryptocurrency pairs track roughly the same price. It is essential for ensuring and recording price movements among the given cryptocurrency pair. In addition, you can prevent the temporary loss  in a more significant measure if the price volatility of a particular cryptocurrency does not exist at the outset.</p>



<p> Consequently, keeping cryptocurrency peers low volatility is a potential key for little or no impermanent loss. The extent of impermanent loss may also be estimated. Taking into account the unpredictable nature of the impermanent loss and its intensity can also be estimated. Support investors in dealing with the complexity of impermanent losses. Several online calculators can help an investor identify the potential risks associated with depositing assets in a specific liquidity pool.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Despite the risk, liquidity providers remain prepared to put down their assets to the extent that it is possible to compensate for such a loss (in whole or part) by charging a fee. The fee is generally paid through decentralized exchanges. The loss becomes permanent only if a provider withdraws its liquid assets permanently. However, they can use measures to mitigate this risk, such as using stablecoin pairs and avoiding volatility.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-liquidity-mining">What is liquidity mining?</h2>



<p>The transformation was pretty quick. It was so promising that it was adopted almost instantly by the people. It seemed logical enough -even to the laypeople- that even the most dubious people couldn&#8217;t ignore it. Bolder investors took the lead in using it to solve many shortcomings of the traditional financial systems. It took a short time for <a href="//web/the-future-of-world-economy/">DeFi to grow in such massive popularity</a>. Soon, investment opportunities that seemed almost impossible with traditional banking were introduced one after the other. One of the myriad opportunities is very attractive to investors: liquidity mining. Let&#8217;s see what it is and how it works.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Liquidity mining (sometimes called yield farming) is the act of lending your cryptocurrencies to a cryptocurrency platform or a DeFi protocol in exchange for rewards. The reward, often in the form of the platform&#8217;s native token, can then be reinvested for higher yields or sold. In essence, it is pretty much like putting your money in the bank and receiving interest. Therefore, when you do liquidity mining, you lend your liquidity to mine (i.e., generate) cryptocurrency. This kind of investment is one of the smartest ways to <a href="//web/how-to-invest-in-bear-market/">earn passive income during a bear market</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-liquidity-mining">What are the benefits of liquidity mining?</h2>



<p>Of course, every kind of investment is considered a win-win approach for both parties. Let&#8217;s consider the example of investing in the bank. The bank needs your money to grow its business, start new projects and invest in large-scale projects. Without people&#8217;s money, no bank would be able to do any of those things. On the other hand, the investor lends their money to the bank and receives interest. Liquidity mining is the same, except for the fact that you are investing in blockchain and DeFi projects. This can have benefits for both the investee and investor.</p>



<p>So, how do DeFi projects take advantage of it? By lending your cryptocurrencies to a project, you are helping it achieve its goals. For a start-up blockchain project to follow its roadmap successfully, it must be crowdfunded. Crowdfunding is a way to raise money from many people to fund a project and kickstart ideas. With the money the project raises, it can plan its future milestones more realistically and robustly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the investor gains profit by investing in the project. Depending on the nature of the project, the investor may receive a share. For example, those who have invested in a decentralized exchange (DEX) may receive a percentage of the transaction fees. Because of its high profits, more and more people are investing their assets in liquidity mining protocols, but before anything, you need to check some things out to ensure your capital stays safe.</p>



<h2 id="h-things-to-consider-before-liquidity-mining">Things to consider before liquidity mining!</h2>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent and yet important thing is to do your research revolving around the project. Make sure you check the project&#8217;s credibility by reading its whitepaper and its roadmap. Finding out how much the project has been able to keep up with its milestones set in the roadmap can be reassuring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, see if its accounts on social media like Discord and Twitter are active and if there is a strong community formed around these social media. So, if, after looking into this information meticulously, you find yourself trusting and seeing a good future in it, you&#8217;re good to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last but not least, it&#8217;s important to know that in liquidity mining, you often receive the native token of that project as your interest. This could be different from what you&#8217;ve invested initially. When investing, you are given several options for the cryptocurrency you are locking into the project. For example, in return, you can lock your USDT in the CrowdSwap project and receive CROWD tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-earn-rewards-with-crowd-mining">Earn rewards with CROWD mining</h2>



<p>As of August 2022, CrowdSwap launched its CROWD mining opportunity, which gives rewards to the participants who provided liquidity. By providing liquidity to CrowdSwap, CROWD market capitalization increases, contributing to less volatility and a steady price increase. On the date of publishing of this article, CrowdSwap offers one CROWD staking and two CROWD mining opportunities. If you don&#8217;t know the difference between yield farming and staking, make sure you read the difference <a href="//web/staking-vs-yield-farming/">here</a>.

<h2 id="h-bear-market-investment">Bear market investment</h2>



<p>So, you&#8217;ve invested in the cryptocurrency market and made a good profit out of its innate volatility. You&#8217;ve come a long way, endured a lot of stress, and seen a lot of dips that turned out to be simple corrections, after which the bull market has continued its way upwards. Everything points to the fact that the market is bullish, and now you are used to these dips as a part of the volatility. One day, another dip comes, and you react as always: keep calm. Then out of nowhere, a heavier correction follows. You get frustrated and start blaming yourself for not acting sooner. Now, you start thinking about reactions that you don&#8217;t normally consider. Welcome to the bearish market!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-does-a-bear-market-last">How long does a bear market last</h2>



<p>A bear market typically starts with a regular dip that happens in every bull market structure. Most investors think that they&#8217;ve failed to sell on time, but historically, bear markets last long enough to let investors modify their investment strategies. In the 2019-2020 period, the downtrend lasted 260 days, during which BTC lost over 80% of its value. Similarly, the 2015 bearish structure, in which BTC fell almost 75% from its ATH, lasted 410 days. The current bear market that we are in has lasted 290 days so far, with BTC down 75% from its ATH.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img width="399" height="225" src="///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12172" srcset="///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1.jpg 399w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1-300x169.jpg 300w, ///wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture1-250x141.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><figcaption><em>BTC bear market durations</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-react-to-the-bearish-market">How to react to the bearish market</h2>



<p>People react differently to the bearish market, the worst of which is inaction! Remaining paralyzed in hope for the return of &#8220;the good old days&#8221; may be the worst possible reaction. Of course, there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to invest in bear market, but it is good to know how successful investors work during one. By reading this article, you can develop a mindset to alter your strategies to minimize your loss or even make a profit in a bear market.Â </p>



<p>It is also important to keep in mind that based on the market you are working in, your strategies may differ. This is mainly because different markets have different investment opportunities specific to them that you need to consider. Because the main focus of this article is to introduce the opportunities that exist in the cryptocurrency market, the options that you can consider are very impressive and countless. So, let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id="h-staking">Staking</h3>



<p>Proof-of-stake (PoS) is one of the very common consensus mechanisms that require the members of the community to lock their assets to be able to participate in the security and stability of that blockchain network and receive a reward in return. Protocols like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Algorand (ALGO) use this kind of consensus mechanism. No matter where your crypto assets are stored, be it in an exchange or a wallet, you can stake (lock) your tokens to earn the reward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main types of staking: locked and flexible. In locked staking, you agree to stake your assets for a certain amount of time to get the rewards, whereas, in flexible staking, you can unstake your assets any time you want. Normally, locked staking generates more rewards than flexible staking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key thing to bear in mind here is that staking can be a good idea only if you plan to keep your assets and not sell them. For instance, for a Cardano holder who does not intend to sell his tokens no matter if the market is bullish or bearish, staking may be a viable option. But obviously, if an investor&#8217;s strategy is to buy lower and sell higher, staking may not apply depending on how long they are planning to hold the asset.</p>



<h3 id="h-yield-farming">Yield farming</h3>



<p>Yield Farming is a way to earn cryptocurrency using another cryptocurrency you already own. In a broad sense, Yield Farming is any effort to work with your crypto assets and get the maximum profit from them. Yield Farming is the practice of staking or freezing cryptocurrencies in exchange for a reward. While the expectation of return on investment is nothing new, the general concept of yield farming originated from the&nbsp;<a href="//web/what-is-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized finance</a>&nbsp;(DeFi) sector. The general idea is that people can earn tokens in exchange for participating in DeFi applications.</p>



<p>Although it may seem that yield farming is the same as staking, the mechanics are quite different. Unlike speakers who are concerned about the security and stability of the blockchain network, yield farmers&#8217; only goal is to make a profit by providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol. By providing liquidity, yield farmers actually participate in different projects, be it a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a lending protocol, or the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, yield farming is not risk-free, plus the profit you get is not a fixed one and can vary depending on the project that you have invested in. On the other hand, different countries set differentÂ <a href="//web/the-future-of-world-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulations for DeFi</a>, which you need to take into account.Â </p>



<h3 id="h-lending">Lending</h3>



<p>Lending is one of the fascinating features of DeFi, which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These platforms enable users to lend and borrow crypto assets as an alternative to the traditional banking systems. By lending your assets to a lending platform like AAVE or COMPOUND, you can receive rewards in return. The process happens in a peer-to-peer manner through a smart contract, and there is no intermediary.</p>



<p>High-interest rates are the incentives that lending protocols offer to attract investment by lenders. These rates may sometimes be up to 20% APY, but you need to be aware of the risks. The risks of lending and borrowing crypto assets stem from the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, which leads to the rapid change in the value of the assets.Â </p>



<h3 id="h-mining">Mining</h3>



<p>Another way to earn profit in a downward market is mining crypto. Basically, mining is the process of solving complex mathematical equations with the help of devices called mining hardware to receive a reward. Mining can be used for tokens that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism like Bitcoin. It is a good way of making passive income, but there are some things that you need to consider about it.</p>



<p>Mining Bitcoin used to be a lot easier and more profitable years ago, and as time goes by, it gets harder. Bitcoin&#8217;s rewards to miners get halved every four years with the aim of keeping it scarce and preventing inflation. In 2009, the reward per block was 50BTC, which was distributed to the miners. However, after three halvings that took place, now the reward is 6.25BTC per block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As it gets harder to mine Bitcoin, you&#8217;re gonna need stronger and more expensive mining hardware to earn a decent reward. What you need to consider if you plan to mine Bitcoin is the cost you pay and the income you earn instead. The profit of mining depends on different factors like your hardware&#8217;s processing power and power consumption, as well as the cost of electricity. Make sure you calculate the cost and the income, and the net profit you are left with.</p>



<h3 id="h-play-to-earn-move-to-earn">Play-to-Earn/Move-to-Earn</h3>



<p>Perhaps playing a game while the market is going down could calm you down a bit, especially games that make you some money! In the crypto world, you can find games that users can play to earn. These games give you tokens as you play, and you can sell them in the market any time you want. One of the most famous play-to-earn games is Axie Infinity, which gives you SLP tokens if you win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another type of these &#8220;-to-earn&#8221; apps is move-to-earn apps that give you tokens for a good cause. They give you tokens in exchange for going outside of your home and exercising. The most popular of these apps is STEPN, which gives GST tokens to users who go out and walk, jog or run. After all, every investor needs to have some time off to get his head clear with some recreational activities to be able to get back to work stronger! So, why not do some sport?</p>



<p>But playing and moving to earn is not free, and it requires some tokens to inves in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For example, in order to be able to play Axie Infinity, you&#8217;re gonna need to purchase at least three Axis, which you can sell later, of course. In the case of STEPN, the user has to buy a pair of shoes to be able to start exercising.</p>



<h4 id="h-final-remarks">Final Remarks</h4>



<p>Investment in every financial market requires the investor to have a set of strategies. Apart from the strategies that are typical of all financial markets, knowing how the specific market you have invested in works is imperative. When the market is booming, investors follow strategies that may not work during the time when the market is going down. Therefore, investing in the bullish market is different from what you can do when the bearish phase comes. This is why you need to prepare yourself for both bullish and bearish scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="h-defi-staking-vs-yield-farming">DeFi Staking vs. Yield Farming</h2>



<p>When it comes to decentralized finances, two concepts cross minds. The first one is staking, and the second one is yield farming. Both terms are somehow similar but not the same. After reading this article, you can define the difference between these two ways of investing money in the DeFi world, and also, you are going to be able to choose which one suits you and you prefer more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-staking-crypto">What Is Staking crypto?</h2>



<p>As we all know, based onÂ <em><a href="//web/what-is-staking-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a></em>, staking crypto is a way of investing tokens in DeFi platforms and earning them back through liquidity pools. It is also known as earning passive income, which means the only thing that an investor should do is to put tokens into a staking app, sign a smart contract and then sit back and watch earned benefits transferred into their wallets. Staking crypto is considered a low-risk investment based on decentralized systems and has been proven very popular lately.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-yield-farming-crypto">What is Yield Farming crypto?</h2>



<p>Put, yield farming is a process to boost returns in DEX (Aka decentralized exchanges.) Crypto users can use a DeFi platform to earn the most reward from investing tokens. Yield farmers can loan, borrow, and stake tokens or coins to earn boosted rewards in return. Here we are going to discuss each way of yield farming relatively.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-staking">Staking&nbsp;</h3>



<p>One way to farm yields is to stake. Through staking, a stakeholder can generate rewards from a liquidity pool provided by the liquidity provider, the platform in which the smart contract and pools are prepared for investors to sign and stake. This way, stakeholders supply a liquidity pool with the significantly earned tokens from the same pool they have already invested in. In other words, when someone earns benefits from staking crypto, they put rewarded tokens and coins again, and LPs (liquidity providers) choose to reward them in return. In this case, they will earn twice as much.</p>



<h3 id="h-crypto-loans-lend-and-borrow-cryptos">Crypto loans: lend and borrow cryptos</h3>



<p>In this case, investors can loan coins or tokens through Defi and become a lender. The benefit of this way is that the holder can yield farm from the interest of the loaned amount. They lend to borrowers via smart contracts in the DEX system. On the other hand, crypto borrowers can also have a good opportunity in yield farming; simultaneously, when they hold the loan, they will also earn benefits from the interest rate of tokens. In addition, when a holder using DeFi protocols lends tokens, they exchange tokens with borrowers; the exchange rate is constantly increasing. So, when they exchange their tokens, they will be more than the original amount. In other words, they will receive the equivalent number of tokens plus the exchange rate benefit. Crypto loans can be a reward for both lenders and borrowers. So, do the mathâeasy benefit for all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-yield-farming-safety-and-risks">Yield Farming Safety and Risks</h2>



<p>As the term speaks for itself, risks in the crypto-currency world are inevitable. But, can the risks of yield farming be calculated? It is better to divide risks into two parts to answer this question. The crystal-clear part depends on the market and regulations in no oneâs control, such as volatility and impermanent loss. The second risk section is what the DeFi platform is responsible for, like rug pulls and smart contract hacks. Discussing the risks and safety of yield farming in detail can be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-volatility">Volatility</h3>



<p>Not only DeFi platforms but also all assets experience volatility. Whether benefit from it or being harmed. Volatility refers to security liability change rates both ways; in a period, a price can rise or fall rapidly and unpredictably. So, it indeed may affect yield farming, too. It is not something for an investor to be scared of but should be alert and put into account.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-impermanent-loss">Impermanent Loss</h3>



<p>As aforementioned, holders deposit tokens in liquidity pools in DeFi staking or yield farming; during volatility, LPs and investors may experience impermanent loss. A liquidity pool is constantly exposed to this risk. It happens when the price of a token in the pool changes. As a result, the value of assets is affected. The price may go both wards; either rise or fall. Again, it is not an issue that LPs are responsible for.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-rug-bulls">Rug Bulls</h3>



<p>When new projects are aroused, scammer developers try to attract investors to participate in the scam project; before the project is built, they close it without giving them any interest. So, vulnerable investors are left with no money. It is a big fraud that any staking crypto or yield farming user should be aware of. Gladly, CrowdSwap can provide security and safety for investors participating in DeFi projects. If you want to invest money, consider CrowdSwap a reliable and secure platform. We assure you there is no need to worry about this risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-smart-contract-hacks">Smart Contract Hacks</h3>



<p>Since DeFi staking crypto and yield farming are available via smart contracts, they can be critical to holders and hackers. And also, because coding cannot be bugless, the bugs can harm holdersâ wallets and be spotted by hackers. CrowdSwap developing team is doing its best to secure investorsâ wallets and prepare a safe and sound platform for its users to experience earning money with no worries.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency-staking-or-yield-farming">How to invest in cryptocurrency?&nbsp; Staking or yield farming</h2>



<p>Now that both DeFi staking and yield farming are clarified, it is time to compare them briefly. In the decentralized finance world, these two terms are close but not equivalent; they provide opportunities for investors to benefit from their investments. Also, on some levels, they may have similar approaches, such as using DeFi-based platforms, available via smart contract, and earning passive income. Still, they indeed have radical differences in substances. Staking provides a less risky protocol for investors, while yield farming is a riskier way of earning interests.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the benefit amount is usually vice-versa. Farmers experience more benefits rather than stakeholders. But the point is that staking crypto has a long-term approach while yield farming is short-term. To put a quick picture in your mind, take a glimpse at the table below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">DeFi Staking</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Yield Farming</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Long-term benefit</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Short-term benefit</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Low-risk</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Almost risky</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Less benefit</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Boosted benefit</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
